Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term &quot;top-fermenting&quot; is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. *&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as &quot;bottom&quot; yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.* &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(all information from &lt;a href=&quot;http://beeradvocate.com/&quot;&gt;http://beeradvocate.com/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22" LastActivityDate="2014-01-21T20:47:17.840" CommentCount="0" />

For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt; was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; was being made as early as the 1300s.

Popsci has a LOT of cool beer articles. Fractional freezing is the best way to increase the alcohol content of beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fractional freezing -- &quot;jacking&quot; in old parlance -- has a long history in the United States. The beverage applejack was produced using this method by first fermenting apple juice into hard apple cider. Then barrels of this cider were left outside during the winter and the connoisseur would occasionally fish out the frozen chunks of water, leaving an ever-concentrated batch of hard alcohol behind. At some point in the 20-25 percent ABV range, the liquor would stop freezing at ambient temperatures and the booze was ready to consume as &quot;Jersey Lightning.&quot; It was also used as currency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving into the malt-beverage world, brewers in Germany use fractional freezing to make eisbock. These brews are usually just regular bock beers, which clock in at 6 percent ABV, freeze-concentrated to something in the 13 percent ABV range. Frankly, there are probably easier ways to get high-proof beers (make a barleywine, for example) than by starting with a mid-strength one and concentrating it, but there's a market for eisbocks and it's possible to find them in the US as well. A more infamous set of freeze-concentrated beers was made by the Scottish brewery BrewDog in their quest to make &quot;the strongest beer in the world.&quot; The first was Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a beer that started with an ABV in the teens and ended at 32 percent ABV. Then a little brewing war started up between BrewDog and German brewery Schorschbräu to make ever-stronger beers. Schorschbräu made a Schorschbock at 40 percent ABV, BrewDog countered with Sink the Bismarck at 41 percent ABV. Then came another beer at 55 percent ABV (that's 110 proof, my friends). Schorschbräu is current record-holder with Schorschbock 57, at 57 percent ABV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/beersci-how-make-strong-beer-stronger&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22" LastActivityDate="2014-01-22T04:13:55.660" CommentCount="2" />

Still others, like Japans Sorachi Ace, offer a more citrus bite to the beer they're added to. While these differences are not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; a product of climate, it's doubtless true that climate has had an impact on the development of variation amongst the various hop lines that have been bred through the centuries -  and especially over the past 50 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put another way: New World vs. Old World Hops is a meaningful distinction, but it has less to do with climate and more to do with the difference in cultivation practices and the specific varietals popular with farmers in various regions.

The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself &quot;caught&quot; by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it'd normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;...but it's not that simple!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can't be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn't be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like &quot;potency,&quot; &quot;sex drive,&quot; and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a very example of the latter, one site [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to &quot;prove&quot; that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I'm not saying beer &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt;, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, &quot;blocks testosterone,&quot; when in fact &lt;em&gt;the very paper it cites&lt;/em&gt; says (in its abstract nonetheless),&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Anti-estrogenic effects of XN [...] were confirmed in vivo in an uterotrophy assay with prepubertal rats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dkfz.de/en/tox/download/gerh/pdf-files/Proc.-2nd-Humulus-Symposium-2009.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Strathmann, J. et al.

Do you know?—I sure don't—and probably no one does—else it'd have been stated by researchers themselves, without the &quot;help&quot; of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In conclusion,&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation).

Gruit was usually sold under papal license exclusive to certain areas at various monasteries and therefore represented a monopoly in Christian areas of the Catholic Church.  Traditionally it included plants such as yarrow, mugwort, henbane, sweet gale, bog rosemary, juniper, and more.  Some of these survive in gin recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why gruit has largely been replaced by hops is a fascinating and divisive historical question.  There may however have been a number of factors including the possibility (largely untested) that hops beers kept longer and the rising concern by Protestant (and even Catholic) nobles of the power of the economic power that this gave Catholic institutions.  What is known is that a campaign was waged against gruit and the purported (and likely actual) mind altering properties of it.  The use of gruit was more or less entirely supplanted by hops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More recently some breweries have been experimenting with gruit beers for national pride and/or historical reasons.

You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can't digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn't work for rice.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian &quot;Tape&quot; (rice or cassava &quot;beer&quot; or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It's very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don't know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine's time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English &quot;beor&quot; means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn't get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don't think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now as for lager, these are far more recent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally as a note, until maybe a hundred years ago, before modern capping and beer cans, most beer would have been sold uncarbonated, but speciality beers were carbonated much like champagne is today.  My own home brewing experiments (I even brew as a history nut) with non-carbonated beers suggest that they are of an altogether different character than carbonated ones (owing to the carbonic acid in carbonated drinks).  The flavors are lighter, sweeter, brighter, and more distinct, and entirely different than &quot;flat&quot; beer.  This is because dissolved carbon dioxide imparts extra acidity to beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  It also occurs to me that controlled fermentation is one of the most common ways of preserving foods in the pre-industrial ages.

Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most (but not all) studies to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency. Alcohol intoxication can decrease sexual arousal, decrease pleasureability and intensity of orgasm, and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since wikipedia show related soruce of that info and most of them are clinical research, we can say that alcohol have a negative effect on men.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In many women, alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, although it does lower the physiological signs of arousal. Women have a different response to alcohol intoxication. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption tends to cause increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Since testosterone controls in part the strength of libido in women, this tends to cause an increase in interest in sex. Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women’s bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm. Some women report a greater sexual arousal with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph, which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different from men, we can say alcohol have more pros beside few cons for women.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Beer and couples&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Men&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beer is probably the least powerful aphrodisiac alcoholic drink. The alcohol percentage in beer is low, meaning that more liquid has to be consumed to raise men's testosterone levels to hit that &quot;comfortable&quot; level. Most beers are very nourishing and filling, and when too many of them are consumed, they can create an unpleasant stomachache. Drinking too much beer will make men go to the washroom more often, as well as create a bloating sensation. The effects of being bloated surely don't entice sexual encounters and won't lead men to seek out sexual opportunities. Yet, some special beers have a local reputation for increasing libido, but even with that, beer is not the best choice for men.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Women&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While hops in beer will have a negative impact on men’s hormonal balance, it may actually be positive for women. Hops has aphrodisiac-like qualities for women, as because of the phytoestrogen it contains, which mimic natural estrogen. Low sex drive in women is often cause by low levels of estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consuming beer, especially hop-rich varieties like IPA, could actually help restore hormonal balance and help with libido and also alleviate menopausal symptoms of fatigue, irritability and hot flashes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="81" LastActivityDate="2014-01-22T22:23:34.453" CommentCount="0" />

Serving beer at too high a pressure, or through a half-open faucet/tap agitates the beer, causing the foam you saw. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The system is balanced by having the pressure inside the keg set to just a touch more (0.5-1psi) than the pressure resistance outside the keg. The pressure resistance outside the keg comes from the beer line and the tap - the longer the beer line, the more resistance. Also any increase in height between the keg and the end of the tap will increase resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even if the system was originally balanced, with the right dispensing pressure or adequate length of beer line, there are still some things working against you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;if the keg has been sloshed about, some of the carbon dioxide will have come out of the beer and into the headspace, creating more pressure.

The first, as you say, is widespread refrigeration.

My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.

As discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/53/does-chocolate-stout-contain-real-chocolate/65#65&quot;&gt;Does chocolate stout contain real chocolate?&lt;/a&gt;, certain flavors can be achieved through the malting process rather than through additional ingredients.

Maple extract or syrup could be used, but syrup is more expensive and fermentable so a stronger maple flavor is being achieved with extract.  The official ingredient list calls for &quot;Pure Maple Flavoring&quot; so I assume the same is being done there.  Lastly the bacon is being added at the end.

This works for me because of very specific reasons and &lt;strong&gt;I am not recommending that anyone else try it.&lt;/strong&gt;  However, I get asthma frequently following upper respiratory illnesses (I have since I was a teenager).  I have a couple of alternative medical strategies for dealing with this depending on what is available.  Note, if you have asthma, don't take medical advice from me: asthma can be life threatening.  Work with a doctor.   However, among other things, I find that drinking a number of drinks of beer or wine for two nights in a row will cause the asthma to clear up until I get sick again.  This naturally works best when I am not otherwise consuming alcohol, but it allows me to be mostly medication free regarding my asthma (doing this two to three times a year).  Again this has a bunch of risks, so I am mentioning it just for informational purposes.

Yes, there are some breweries such as  Dogfish Head who recreate ancient ales. Yards has also recreated three brews based upon George Washington's, Thomas Jefferson's, and Ben Franklin's (my favorite of the three) original recipes. But for the most part, beer has evolved in the last 300-500 years; even in the case of the Dogfish Head and Yards brews I mentioned since they have to be pasteurized and must meet the (stupid) FDA standards here in the US. If you've ever tried raw milk, you know how much pasteurization changes the flavor; same goes for juice and beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said, lets go back to the whole top-fermenting thing.

It isn't a question of availability today but there are other factors that likely have seasonal impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally (say, 1000 years ago), yes, brewing recipes would vary with the seasons.  Some ingredients like henbane seed or barley keep extremely well.  Others do better  fresh (herbs and such).  It is likely that gruit components varied with the seasons.  This is not an issue today.  Aside from some components of other beers (pumpkin ale, beers with seasonal fruit), most beers today do not involve ingredients that are problematic to preserve over a year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a second issue though.  That is that beers traditionally have another factor which is starch content.  The starch contributes significantly to calorie count of the beer, and usually darker, richer beers have higher carbohydrate count.  It makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather, and it makes sense that darker, heavier beers would be favored in winter while lighter beers would be favored in summer (although as one would note the heavier beers came out of traditions of using them as bread substitutes for fasting monks and so would have year-round applicability in monasteries).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it has to do with availability.  I think instead it has to do with seasonal expectations and reserving richer, heavier, higher starch beers for the winter (we have higher metabolism in winter, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf&lt;/a&gt;, and generally less availability of fresh foods before modern refrigeration and rapid transport).  I don't know when this became common though.  In general, when I look back a thousand years ago, I don't see anything in primary sources to suggest heavier malts in the winter.  So trying to date this would seem speculative.  There is a fairly obvious practical pattern though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  As I think about this, I would note that aside from lagers, it is very hard to brew in the winter in a colder climate.

These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer I think to the question as stated has to be &quot;no&quot; insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while &quot;&lt;em&gt;ealu&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (-&gt; ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, &quot;&lt;em&gt;beor&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (-&gt; beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen (&quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot;) suggests that &quot;beor&quot; must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources on history&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hagen, Ann.  &quot;&lt;em&gt;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pollington, Stephen.  &quot;&lt;em&gt;Leechcraft&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (for an edition of Bald's Leechbook with facing page translation).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:  Medieval Iceland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (&lt;em&gt;godhi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bondi&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;thrall&lt;/em&gt;) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a &lt;em&gt;godhi&lt;/em&gt; (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a &lt;em&gt;godhord&lt;/em&gt; (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A &lt;em&gt;bondi&lt;/em&gt; (free juryman) owned land.  And a &lt;em&gt;thrall&lt;/em&gt; was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill's Saga, Njall's Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from &quot;continental&quot; Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki's Saga.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It's probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There's a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further reading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the various sagas referenced above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/em&gt; (I usually recommend the Hollander translation if you are going to work in translation because he tends to be transparent about which emendations he is using).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Byock, Jesse:  &lt;em&gt;Viking-Age Iceland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Byock, Jesse:  &lt;em&gt;Medieval Iceland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Roesdahl, Else: &lt;em&gt;The Vikings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pollington, Stephen: &lt;em&gt;Leechcraft&lt;/em&gt; (for some archaeological discussions of Scandinavian forts and brewing).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="117" LastEditorUserId="2585" LastEditDate="2014-12-20T02:01:47.893" LastActivityDate="2014-12-20T02:01:47.893" CommentCount="0" />

The tang you feel is dissolved metal and a component of that, depending on the pewter, may be lead (or could be copper, tin, bismuth, antimony, etc).  A major factor in that is acidity, and both hops and carbonation contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acidic solutions react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and dissolved metal salts.  So carbonic acid from carbonated beer will react with the tin to produce hydrogen and tin carbonate, and the same basic process with other metals.

Could be fun, though.  :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most commercial beer is &lt;em&gt;force-carbonated&lt;/em&gt;.

The beer is intentionally left with a little of the yeast from the fermentation process, and is sealed with the sugar.  The yeast then does it's normal thing: it eats the sugar and excretes alcohol plus carbon-dioxide.  Since the bottle is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, so it goes into dissolution in the beer, giving you that fizz.  Most bottled homebrew will be like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you have a beer that is both flat and was bottle-conditioned (and therefore still has some yeast in it), you might be able to bottle-ferment it again:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add a very small amount of sugar to the bottle.  Table sugar works, although corn sugar (which you can find from a brew store) is ideal.  It'll be really hard to get the right amount (about 0.083 oz), so I recommend pre-measured tablets of the stuff: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/munton-s-carb-tabs.html&quot;&gt;http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/munton-s-carb-tabs.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seal the bottle somehow.

According to it, the suggested pairing for an IPA is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Strong, spicy food (classic with curry!); bold, sweet desserts like carrot cake&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and for a Double/Imperial IPA is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Smoked beef brisket, grilled lamb; Southern chicken-fried steak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found a great little &lt;a href=&quot;http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/03/what-to-eat-with-ipa-india-pale-ale-food-pairings.html&quot;&gt;summary by Michael Agnew (2012)&lt;/a&gt; that explains some of the rationale behind these pairings (emphasis mine hereon):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When pairing IPA with food you have three basic flavor hooks at your disposal; bitterness, hop flavor (spicy, grassy, herbal, earthy, and citrus), and caramel. Hop flavors have a great affinity for spices and light fruits. Bitterness has a cooling affect. Paired with &lt;strong&gt;spicy dishes&lt;/strong&gt;, IPA will fan the flames at first, but douse them in the end. Bitterness also amplifies &lt;strong&gt;salty and umami flavors&lt;/strong&gt;. The caramel flavors in the beer will latch onto the sweeter side of a dish, tying into things like &lt;strong&gt;caramelized onion&lt;/strong&gt; or the crispy skins of roast poultry. And the hop acids and carbonation make IPAs &lt;strong&gt;great palate cleansers&lt;/strong&gt; to take on even the fattiest deep-fried delights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Samuel Adams has a &quot;Pair with Sam&quot; tool, and looking at its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samueladams.com/food-and-craft-beer/pair-with-sam?beer-name=whitewater-ipa&amp;amp;beerid=7abae512-5798-4f59-bd3e-98698adcd1bf&quot;&gt;suggested pairings for their Whitewater IPA&lt;/a&gt; (hoppier than their Latitude 48 IPA), &lt;strong&gt;pork appears to be the meat of choice: pulled pork, barbeque ribs, chorizo, roasted pork tenderloin, and sweet sausage&lt;/strong&gt;; and the rest of its suggestions align with the salty-and-spicy pattern we've  seen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We seem to have found strong consensus already, but just one more to make sure.

The latter is most affected by the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; of increase in blood-alcohol concentration: the greater this rate of increase, the greater the disturbance of function at any absolute concentration. The diuretic response, on the other hand, is dependent mainly on the &lt;em&gt;duration&lt;/em&gt; of increasing blood-alcohol concentration and not on the rate of increase (Tables 6, 7). The naturally slow absorber, therefore, tends to give a larger diuretic response than the rapid absorber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The slower you get drunk, the more dehydrated you'll be!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="73" LastActivityDate="2014-02-01T10:19:08.893" CommentCount="0" />

It’s a sentiment backed by Patrick Langlois at&#xA;  Great Divide in Denver, brewers of notable hoppy beers including their&#xA;  Fresh Hop Pale Ale, Titan IPA, and Hercules Double IPA. “Hops tend to&#xA;  dissipate in three to four months, which is why that is the&#xA;  recommended shelf life for most of our beers. &#xA;  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://beeradvocate.com/community/threads/how-much-does-keeping-a-beer-cold-really-help-retain-hop-aroma.6336/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Barley Wines - Oxidation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Barley wines are not hop flavor or aroma focused beers - the major hop component is bittering acids, so they don't suffer the same problem with aroma losses as IPAs. However, some of the bittering compounds also have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;amp;pid=S0100-40422000000100019&quot;&gt;half-life of 1 year&lt;/a&gt;, so clear changes are happening in that timeframe to the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the major change for a barleywine is oxidation. There is always oxygen in the beer - either small amounts introduced during packaging, or from oxidization during the mash, which is then later released into the beer. When alcohol in the beer oxidizes, it becomes ethanal (acetaldehyde) which is a main component in sherry, and gives apple or sherry-like tones, which in a big barleywine are considered positive effects of aging, if kept in check. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Stouts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrasting with both IPAs and barleywines, Stouts that are meant for aging are neither hop focused nor benefit much from oxidation. Oxidizing the medium roasted malts in the wort would produce cardboard flavors due to production of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brewingreality.blogspot.no/2010/04/flavour-compound-of-week-trans-2.html&quot;&gt;trans-2-nonenal&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, the highly kilned malts act as an anti-oxidant to help prevent the beer from oxidizing.

I think you have to look at these laws as an intersection of the practical and the cultural.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at two different distinctions you make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the US, you can usually make your own beer, mead, or wine, but cannot make hard liquor without a license from BATF, state licenses, tax payments, etc.  Exact laws of course vary state by state, but the US tax code contains exemptions for home brewers and wine makers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason here is historical.  Liquor is a major tax source, and black market liquor hasn't always been very safe.  We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don't believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="117" LastActivityDate="2014-02-03T08:57:40.450" CommentCount="0" />

Since its is mostly water, you can compare beer’s density to water to find out how much other stuff is in it.  Water has a gravity of 1.000, and beers will often have an original gravity of 1.200 to 1.020.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Original Gravity” is the density of beer before it’s fermented (when it’s called ‘wort’), and “Final Gravity” is the density after it’s fermented.  You can determine the alcohol content of a beer by comparing the two gravities and inferring how much fermentable “stuff” disappeared during fermentation (i.e., was converted to alcohol and CO2).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In commercial beer, you can use OG as a shorthand for how “Big” the beer is because it indicates how much malt and other fermentable stuff was in it.  So a lighter-flavored beer like a blonde or a pilnser will often have a low original gravity (1.020 to 1.050, for example), whereas a big stout or barelywine might have a higher original gravity (1.080 up to as much as 1.200).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OG is in important measurement for home brewers, so another use of it on a commercial beer is to help people produce clones of said beer at home by reproducing the OG (among other factors).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Definition&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get a little more technical, Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one liquid to another.  In brewing, we always use water.  So, the density of water divided by the density of water is 1.000.  The density of beer divided by the density of water is what we refer to as ‘gravity’ when discussing beer.  And since it’s a ratio of two identical measures, there are no units.

The units here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Strength&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;degrees Plato&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;deg;P), which describe the amount of dissolved sugars.

This means the beer (or more correctly, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wort&lt;/a&gt;) contained 15% sugar before fermentation started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RDF - The real degree of fermentation. This is in contrast to the Apparent Degree of Fermentation, which is (OG-FG)/OG. When the final gravity is measured using hydrometer, the alcohol in the beer, being less dense than water (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SG. 0.789&lt;/a&gt;) causes the gravity to appear lower, so it looks as though the yeast has fermented more sugar than it actually has. The Real degree of Fermentation takes the alcohol into account and computes the actual amount of sugars fermented.

This shows that knowing the residual sugars doesn't tell you the sweetness, simply because there are different kinds of residual sugar.

The reason has nothing to do with alcohol content or getting drunk (some beers like Belgian tripels, imperial stouts, or barley wines can easily clock in at a higher ABV than wines). It's got more to do with the human tongue itself and how taste buds are organized on the tongue. Essentially, beer is a much more complex drink; beer tasters use all of their taste buds while wine drinkers may only use a select few. So when you drink beer, you're not going to be overwhelming any set of taste buds unevenly while you run that risk when drinking wine.  Generally when drinking wine, you're only using your sweet and sour sets of taste buds. For instance, I don't know about you, but I've never really had a bitter wine. I've had sweet or sour wines, but never bitter or salty wines. On the other hand, I've had all of that with beer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the diagram of the tongue below, you'll notice that the bitter taste bud receptors are on the back of the tongue.

Almost all imported retail beer is pasteurized. The reason for pasteurizing the beer is from a business standpoint. It basically allows the beer to last longer and be shipped at room temperature (this applies to kegs, cans, and bottles). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to the pasteurization process is bottle conditioning. Most domestic beers follow this path. Essentially this process involves beers being sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/pasteurized-and-non-pasteurized-keg-beer-aid-45.html&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically the probability that the beer begins to ferment is higher over time. A canned beer and a keg beer can taste the same if they both left the brewery at the same time, and both experienced the same conditions during the time it took them to reach you. It is just that kegs have a better chance of taking less time and of being better preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a practical standpoint though, bottles can cause broken glass, kegs weigh close to 50 lbs. full, and cans allow for shotgunning.

Beer is technically not distilled. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the definition you cited says, beer is the product of fermenting sugar derived from cereal grain which is dissolved in water. So water + grain + yeast = beer. The grain has to undergo a saccharification process where the carbohydrate chains (starches) in the grain are transformed into sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose...) which is then converted into alcohol by yeast. Fermentable sugar is extracted from barley through &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;malting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_%28beer%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mashing&lt;/a&gt;. The yeast is generally added to the &lt;em&gt;wort&lt;/em&gt; (unfermented sugary water) manually by the brewer or wild yeast can fall into the beer from the air. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other processes may be involved with fermenting other grains. For example, in sake brewing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/05/making-koji-for-sake.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;koji&lt;/a&gt; (a type of mold) is grown on rice (and soybeans) before fermentation in order to convert starches into fermentable sugars, as rice does not contain the enzymes needed to convert its starches into sugars (note: sake is generally not consider beer, but there are beers made with significant quantities of rice, up to 100% rice beer is possible).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hops is not a necessary ingredient in beer, and beer was made for thousands of years before people started adding hops to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These strong beers like Snake Venom are generally brewed to this high ABV level through freeze &quot;distillation.&quot; This isn't really distillation, because no heat is involved, so people still call them beers. But this is a concentration process similar to distillation. Alcohol has a lower freezing point than water, so when you freeze beer, you can remove the ice and you're left with a more concentrated beer. This is the process used in the German eisbock style. The brewers also start with a high ABV beer, using special ingredients (sugar sources other than malt, like table sugar) along with strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol and still continue to live and ferment. This process can be somewhat difficult and expensive, so it gets attention. In my opinion it's a novelty, but I guess people like it, because they sell a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="94" LastEditorUserId="94" LastEditDate="2014-03-30T18:49:31.573" LastActivityDate="2014-03-30T18:49:31.573" CommentCount="3" />

Generous spicy, peppery,&#xA;  sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus&#xA;  fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana&#xA;  character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop&#xA;  character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in&#xA;  intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is&#xA;  light. No diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.&#xA;  Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in&#xA;  characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a&#xA;  soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.&#xA;  Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes&#xA;  lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.&#xA;  Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.&#xA;  Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop&#xA;  bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and&#xA;  bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No&#xA;  diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the&#xA;  substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high&#xA;  carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but&#xA;  little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy&#xA;  character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but&#xA;  slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded&#xA;  malt flavor but should not be sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The&#xA;  best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and&#xA;  attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the&#xA;  perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30&#xA;  IBUs and are very dry.

Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast&#xA;  strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics&#xA;  and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation&#xA;  temperatures.

Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To answer your question:&lt;/strong&gt;  Mulled beer &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.  The characteristics I'd look for would be a heavy body, more malty than hoppy, a bit of sweetness, and if present, dark fruit (plumbs, figs, raisins) or berries.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2014-02-13T14:54:30.793" CommentCount="1" />

A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all of this, I am referring to room temperature.

The style was most likely originated at Westmalle in the mid 19th Century.

They're not as popular amongst American brewers as triples though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as flavor profile, it's a malty but dry beer.  The Belgian abbey yeast strains will ferment the beer fairly dry but will create a whole host of fruity esters and spicy phenols that will add to the mid range caramel malts.

Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red Label, New Belgium Abbey, St. Martin Brune are all good examples of the style.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regards to AudiFanatic's answer, In this case, Beer Advocate is wrong in their description of a Triple. Triples do NOT use 3x's the malt as a Single.  No brewer will tell you that, nor is it true historically.  Malt extraction is linear, meaning 3x's the malt will be 3x's the alcohol.  The closest you get to that is historically when the single was the 3rd running (like a small beer). With this method, the 1st run had triple the fermentables extracted than the 3rd run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And while I may only be a blogger, with 13 years of industry experience, I spoke with highly trained brewmasters and read references written by authoritative experts.

As such, the distinguishing factor is bitterness.  :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since hops are the primary contributor to bitterness in beer, high IBU beers also tend to be hoppy (although that's not always the case, since hops added at certain points in the brewing process contribute mostly to bitterness, while hops added at other points contribute mostly to hop aroma and flavor).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, heavier beers (specifically, those with lots of malt) will taste less bitter than a lighter beer with the same IBU.  To elaborate:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;there is still the complication that IBUs do not really correlate with perceived bitterness because other aspects of beer affect the perception of bitterness. For example, two beers containing 25 IBUs will be perceived very different with respect to bitterness if one beer had an O.G. of 10 °Plato and finished at 1.5 °Plato and the other beer had an O.G. of 12.5 °Plato and finished at 2.5 °Plato. Begin varying the malt bill by adding crystal malt, for example, and changing the content of various water salts and things become even muddier.

Is there more definitive evidence for the year of birth of the yard, besides the milestone in their history of the introduction of flint glass? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm also curious about whether the volume of the glass was satisfying to stagecoach drivers because of their need to wait long periods for their passenger, or whether it was just easier to hand them a tall glass as they remained in the seat. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="121" LastActivityDate="2014-03-08T13:42:26.437" Title="What are the true origins of the yard of ale?"

With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called &lt;a href=&quot;http://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/medovukha/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Medovukha&lt;/a&gt;, which is made with honey and yeast. It's apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you've got Russian honey cakes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://russian.lingualift.com/blog/honey-tradition-russia/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;other food based items&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it's antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I'd be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn't use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I've used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some substantiating points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Baltika Medovoe Light seems to be a popular &quot;first Russian beer&quot; to try.

The first was called the &quot;Honey&quot; (&lt;em&gt;medovyi&lt;/em&gt;) or &quot;Wet Savior&quot; (&lt;em&gt;mokryi Spas&lt;/em&gt;), signifying either the gathering of honey or the religious procession and blessing of the waters traditional for this day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ivanits, L. &quot;Russian Folk Belief.&quot; [http://books.google.com]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;According to Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevskii (1841–1911), we must learn about the Russian forest, river and steppe in order to understand the Russian people.

I was lucky enough to visit Westvleteren a while ago and found out that in the nearby cafe you also could buy one crate per person, however there were only about 100 crates available that day and only one type was available. You can drink all types though by ordering it to drink in the café (3 types).&#xA;If you would ever want to taste Westvleteren but cannot find it, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 is a very similar beer.

I looked up Stella Artois' production figures (and not because it's Belgian—it was just the first popular, global beer to come to mind), and found that in 2012 they produced a little over 10,000,000 hectoliters that year. Divide that by Chimay's 120,000 hectoliters per annum. Can I believe that 83 units of Stella are being consumed for every 1 equivalent unit of Chimay?

Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn't hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn't confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to &quot;sessionize&quot; and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: &lt;a href=&quot;http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20&quot;&gt;http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20&lt;/a&gt;  I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that's more like a carbonated lemonade than what we'd think of as soda.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to their reputation, if you'll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel's and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn't ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren't even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they'll become more accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastActivityDate="2014-03-27T19:47:31.307" CommentCount="1" />

It turns out that you have a few options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can call and make an appointment and IF you get an&#xA;appointment then you must drive there at the appointed time to pick&#xA;up your crate of bier.

They will not allow you to make 2 appointments with the same license plate number in a 60 day period. Additionally, the phone number you must call to get an appointment is always busy, I have heard of people using automatic redial for hours before they finally get through. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are in the area (again you will need a car, because there is no public transport, and biking there is unreasonable from most places.) You can pop in and there is a small shop next to the monastery where you can buy a 6 pack per person without appointment, and also with out a huge price markup. Of course while you are there you can also eat some good food, and buy other items that the monks make and sell. This is much less hassle, but you cannot get much bier, so it may not be worth trekking all the way out there specifically for this.

You said it's a home built system, yes?  So is this a mini-fridge conversion, chest freezer/keezer conversion, or some other kit?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what length are the beer lines?  Generally you need to balance CO2 pressure against beer lines to avoid consistently foamy pours.  If your system isn't properly balanced the beer will always be foamy, on every pour.  I have 5-6 foot lines in my kegerator and it works pretty well for me, when I was having foamy pour problems everyone suggested replacing them with 10 foot lines just to make damn sure the pour wasn't too violent.  Also making sure the lines are clean.  Any beer stone or other sediment in the lines is going to cause foam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Serving warmer with lower CO2 would also be a better step.  One frustrating thing about these sorts of adjustments is that it takes time for equilibrium to be hit.  So if you lower the CO2 pressure, the headspace is still pressurize.  You'll need to vent the keg via the pressure release valve.  Same deal with raising the temperature.  Once the beer actually comes up to the new temp, there will have been CO2 driven out of solution that you need to vent from the headspace via the pressure release valve.  It's a pain.  Regulators will also often have their own pressure valve, which you should poke and vent slightly when setting the pressure...especially when coming down since excess pressure in the system is going to mess with the reading.  So vent, watch it rise to the actual pressure, then adjust, vent again, and watch.  It takes some time but generally once you set it there's very little change required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell without seeing the speed of your pour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Definitely check the keg temperature itself.  As a homebrewer I reuse kegs, so I have stickers on all my kegs that have a little temperature line.  These liquid crystal thermometers, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00026Z4PS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; title=&quot;this one&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, are pretty cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also check the ambient temperature using a regular thermometer and a small glass of water.  You should check temperature at multiple spots inside the kegerator, so you could fill some tumblers or shot glasses with water and place them at the bottom of the kegerator, then maybe on top of the keg, and then maybe a back shelf if you have anything like that.  This lets you know if you have any hot spots which you can reduce by reorganizing tubes or tossing a small computer case fan in there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you haven't disabled the dome light in the fridge, do so or find some way to make sure the switch stays down beyond a doubt.  When I first built my kegerator I was getting incredibly foamy pours and a huge contributor wound up being the dome light kept coming on and heating up the tops of the kegs and the beer in my lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another final check is the temperature inside of the tower.  If you have no way for the cold air to get from the body of the fridge into the tower the lines in the tower will get warm and cause foamy beer, though if the CO2 pressure is set correctly, this would likely only result in the first 1-2 pours being foamy, then it calms down until the lines warm back up.  A lot of people will put fans or run copper tubes up the towers.  I filled mine with insulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastActivityDate="2014-05-01T12:40:35.717" CommentCount="0" />

Ignoring the taste of hoppiness, which is different from bitterness (dear Bob that myth needs to die), there's a limit to how much bitterness we humans can actually perceive.  Past about 100 IBUs the tongue straight up can't tell that there are any more.  Now we perceive the quality of bitterness differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So bitterness in beer is provided primarily by adding hops and boiling them for a long time.  The length of time and pH of the wort affects a chemical reaction called &quot;Isomerization&quot;, which is the process by which Alpha Acids in hop oils become Iso-Alpha Acids which stay stably in solution and make beer taste bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are also Beta Acids.  Generally these are in 1:1 ratio with the Alpha acids but sometimes there are more or less depending on the hop types.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beta Acids are chemically Lupulones and Alpha Acids are Humulones.  We've identified 3 types of each as well: No prefix, Co-, and Ad-.  Most homebrewing hop packets list total alpha acid %, then % of those acids that are Cohumulone.  But straight IBUs don't take which acids were used to get to that number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humulone is thought to give the best, smoothest, most pleasing bitterness.  Cohumulone can be pretty abrasive, and the bitterness may seem rougher or more astringent...or just more bitter, even at the same IBUs.  Beta acids are also thought of as a &quot;rough&quot; bitterness, but they primarily produce bitterness via oxidation and can help long term shelf-stability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what all this really helps to answer, but I guess the main points are that you can't taste past 100 IBUs, but there are qualities to bitterness that can make some beers more abusive than others.  Also my final point is that hop flavor and aroma don't make a beer bitter.  If the hops have been boiled enough to actually make a beer that bitter...you do not taste those hops.  You can have hoppy beers that are smooth and not bitter at all by hop selection, yeast selection, dry hopping, and not boiling them hops very much.  You can also make beer more bitter by yeast selection and certain grains.  You can also make Ruination or Palate Wrecker, but the point is that hoppiness and bitterness are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastEditorUserId="268" LastEditDate="2014-05-01T13:42:42.137" LastActivityDate="2014-05-01T13:42:42.137" CommentCount="0" />

Obviously under beer you then have ales, lagers, ciders, perrys, meads, stouts, bitters and probably a million others, and probably further sublevels (dry cider, sweet cider, sparkling cider....), but is there a second level &quot;beer&quot; also at this level?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Really, is there actually a single specific drink that is a &lt;em&gt;beer&lt;/em&gt; that is not further defined as, for example, an IPA, or a Stout?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="902" LastActivityDate="2014-06-04T18:25:44.907" Title="What is the definition of Beer or the Beer &quot;family&quot; of drinks" Tags="&lt;history&gt;&lt;terminology&gt;" AnswerCount="4" CommentCount="0" />

Beer is made from malted grain, which must first be mashed to convert starch into fermentable sugars. Beer must contain 4 essential ingredients: Malt extract (from the grain), hops, water and yeast. It may contain others as well, but if any of these four are missing it is not beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that your premise of &quot;that alcoholic drinks are essentially either Beers Wines or Spirits.&quot; is wrong because it oversimplifies and excludes some beverages. Besides mead and cider, there are also malt-based alcho-pop beverages (Mike's Hard Lemon, Twisted Tea, etc.) that I would not call beer either - they contain 3 of the four ingredients, but lack hops. There are other local indigenous alcoholic beverages around the world that don't fit any of these categories, like Japanese sake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many styles of beer -- so the word &quot;beer&quot; refers to all of them, and there is no style that is called just &quot;beer&quot;. Here is a link that describes many styles of beer, mead and cider. Note that this is not a comprehensive list; brewers keep developing new styles all the time to create desirable products. For example, Black IPAs came into vogue a couple of years ago, now I am seeing White IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php&quot;&gt;BJCP Style Descriptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="381" LastEditorUserId="381" LastEditDate="2014-05-20T18:22:05.753" LastActivityDate="2014-05-20T18:22:05.753" CommentCount="5" />

Brewers, like any other businesses, like for the general public to know that the anonymous tapped beer you're drinking is theirs.  That is why they provide branded glasses to bars, and request (or require) that their beer be served in their glasses.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there a benefit to the mildly curved shape of this glass for this type of beer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my observations, yes, there is.  While the throat may not narrow as severely as a brandy snifter, the effect of concentrating the aroma is still achieved. Eyeballing it, I'd say that the curvature is somewhere in between that of my champagne flutes and my red wines glasses, which are presumed to have the same general effect.  More generally I'd say that a glass with a narrowing or restricted throat does concentrate the aroma, and the degree of restriction doesn't seem to matter significantly, to my nose.  (Assuming it isn't &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; great, that is.  Beer in a bottle or can, for instance, is definitely at a disadvantage.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to also look at a few of the reasons they state in their marketing material as well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The authentic shape of the body encourages the perfect balance of C02 and liquid, enhancing head retention and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have any evidence to back this up, but I suspect that this is probably the most legitimate of the claims.  This would have a significant effect on the experience of drinking the beer, it is going to be specific to their recipe, and it's a reason that's often given for custom beer glassware.  (Boston Beer Company laser etches the bottom of their Sam Adams Boston Lager glass to enhance cavitation, for instance.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The angles at the bottom cause a wave that works in harmony with the liquid alchemy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what this means.  Alchemy is the term for pre-chemistry, and primarily deals with trying to turn ordinary substances into gold.  I assume they're trying to insinuate that the glass magically turns Stella into better beer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The stem provides a means to hold the chalice so that the Stella Artois stays cold longer &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is plausible, and perhaps unfortunate.  This is why you are supposed to hold red wine glasses by the bowl (to warm the wine) and white wine glasses by the stem (to keep it cool.)   However, with wine, a serving is generally five ounces or so, compared to twelve or more of lager.   The effect certainly won't be the same given the significantly higher mass.   The unfortunate bit is that colder is not generally what you want when you're talking about good beer.  Colder is the realm of the cheap macro-brews like Coors Light.   Cold subdues flavor compounds, which is useful when the flavor of the beer is nasty, and not so useful when it's pleasant.  This certainly isn't a a requirement or general best practice for lagers as you won't find stemmed glassware used for Boston Beer's Samuel Adams Lager glass: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/DMcwF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Samuel Adams Boston Lager Glass&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or my classic Spiegelau Lager glass: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wn6wv.png&quot; alt=&quot;Speieglau lager glass&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or any of the glasses you'll see used for the many fine Lagers of Germany.  So, I have to suppose one of the following two reasons.  First, they may simply be pandering to the general belief that colder beer is better.  Second, it would be unfortunate if they were trying to hide a lack of quality by trying to ensure the beer was too cold to taste properly.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, and I've left this to last, because it's purely my opinion...I think they've chosen the chalice glass specifically because it's fancy, and that's the image they want to portray for their beer.  When people see the Stella glass, they don't want their beer to be lumped in with the pint-glass styles, they want it to stand out as sophisticated, and the chalice specifically gives it that cachet.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, my top line and bottom line are down to marketing, with a bit of truth and a bit of fiction to all the bits in between. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2014-05-21T01:20:03.927" CommentCount="1" />

In London (UK) we have a brewery producing a 2.8% abv beer (Redemption brewery, beer name escapes me) which is packed with hops and of greater hop depth than many IPAs. Batches of a beer that are brewed to be low alcohol will necessarily be different to those brewed at full strength which is why I would hope (pray?) that any brewer whose product is worth drinking would make a different beer, brewed at low strength for these markets. These beers can be as flavoursome and exciting as, if not more so than, higher strength beers.&#xA;The process to make the beer lower ABV is simply reducing the amount of sugar that can be converted into alcohol by using a lower sugar content mash either using specific lower sugar malts, using less malt, or using a yeast that will not support higher alcohol concentrations (alcohol kills yeast...!). Using less yeast won't work as the given yeast will continue to multiply to make up the shortfall. If you are not making real beer halting the fermentation early by killing the yeast with heat (or similar) will produce a lower alcohol beer but it will be sweeter as there is more unfermented sugar. Fining and serving real ale before fermentation has produced a higher strength may have a similar effect for those types of beer.&#xA;Since alcohol dissolves flavouring compounds better than water it is much harder to brew a highly flavoured weak beer &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; this may be offset by taste complexity.&#xA;Larger breweries will reduce alcohol levels chemically post-production by boiling off alcohol or similar. this will reduce the flavouring compounds in the beer (see GCSE fractional distillation notes or similar for details) and so make the beer taste weaker. These are produced at mass market quantities and even the full strength product is pretty awful compared with crafted or real beers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="909" LastActivityDate="2014-05-29T09:44:03.633" CommentCount="0" />

The same is true for Heineken - their Quality Assurance team will have been given clear guidelines on the spec for the beer, both as hard and fast measurable, objective facts (IBUs, Color, carbonation, diacetyl, fusel alcohols, esters etc...) and also as subjective - how it tastes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the final answer about why one beer is more bitter than another is because their respective breweries have decided that's the flavor they want, and they have crafted a brew to produce their chosen flavor profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastActivityDate="2014-06-03T16:20:41.837" CommentCount="0" />

The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck's is wholly owned by AB InBev.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.

Beck's claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it's a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it's in the Pilsner style so while it's still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.

You might also be interested in any brewery's Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch's are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does that help?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastEditorUserId="1454" LastEditDate="2014-12-05T20:12:44.053" LastActivityDate="2014-12-05T20:12:44.053" CommentCount="9" />

Low to moderate maltiness supports the&#xA;  hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty&#xA;  malt character (bready, toasty, biscuity). Fruity esters vary from&#xA;  moderate to none. No diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy&#xA;  notes, although this character should not be excessive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance:&lt;/strong&gt; Pale golden to deep amber. Moderately large white to&#xA;  off-white head with good retention.

Low&#xA;  to moderately high clean malt character supports the hop presentation,&#xA;  and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character&#xA;  (bready, toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late&#xA;  hops and bitterness, but the malt presence can be substantial. Caramel&#xA;  flavors are usually restrained or absent. Fruity esters can be&#xA;  moderate to none. Moderate to high hop bitterness with a medium to dry&#xA;  finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into the finish. No&#xA;  diacetyl.

There aren't that many, but with a population of only 300,000 people that's to be expected. The main ones are Einstök, Borg, Gædingur, and Ölvisholt. There's also Stedji and Kaldi, but these are less interesting. I felt Gædingur was a bit variable on quality. Note that none of these produce extreme beers. They focus more on drinkability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only Borg is in Reykjavik. I don't know if you can visit the brewery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can't buy interesting beer in Icelandic supermarkets, because the alcohol limit is 2.25%. As far as I could tell, only 4 beers were available in supermarkets, all of them pale lagers. You have to go to Vinbudin. There's a branch in the Austurstræti in the city centre, but the one out in the Kringlan shopping center has a bigger selection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look for these bars in the Reykjavik city centre: Micro Bar, Cafe Laundromat, K-Bar, and 73.

It's worth mentioning up front that there are certain taste aversions that people have to different beers.  You mentioned getting her into a vanilla porter.  I have a favorite from Mill Street in Canada; they make a great vanilla porter.  The caveat though is that I like coffee a lot, and many people averse to beer tend to have trouble with the intense flavors of different varieties of beer, such as extreme hoppiness, heavily malted barley, or, darkly roasted barley that make up stouts and porters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mentioned less fruity beers, but talked about &quot;Wild Blue&quot; when you mentioned that.  Wild Blue is a Blueberry flavored lager; it's basically a &quot;regular beer,&quot; but is infused with blueberry flavor to change it up.  I would look at other &quot;fruity&quot; styles that are still very authentic and internationally renowned, but pack less of a general beer flavor than a filtered rice/grain/barley beer would...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good starter would be a more heavily wheat based beer.  Styles like Belgian wheats or German hefeweizens have less of that pronounced &quot;regular beer&quot; flavor, but are still in their own right, very prolific styles.  I tend to find Belgian wheats/&quot;weisse/wittes(whites)&quot; to be a bit more &quot;chewy&quot; with more of a banana/coriander flavor than their full blown German counterparts.  Good wheats that I would recommend would be Franziskaner or Hoegaarden.  They're safe forays into that style of beer that I almost always tend to get for new drinkers.  The cool thing is that if she likes them, you can really experiment with other varieties in that field.  Belgian doubles and triples tend to generally fall into a similar category, and they're arguably some of the finest beers in the world...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1120" LastActivityDate="2014-08-06T16:57:38.080" CommentCount="4" />

Alexander were unconvinced by the virtual Guinness model and decided to put it to the test by analysing it physically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed, Andy and I first disbelieved this and wondered if the people had had maybe too much Guinness to drink,&quot; Zare recalled. &quot;We tried our own experiments, which were fun but inconclusive. So Andy got hold of a camera that takes 750 frames a second and recorded some rather gorgeous video clips of what was happening.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A careful analysis of the video confirmed findings: Beer bubbles do sink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The answer turns out to be really very simple. It's based on the idea of what goes up has to come down. In this case, the bubbles go up more easily in the centre of the beer glass than on the sides because of drag from the walls. As they go up, they raise the beer, and the beer has to spill back, and it does. It runs down the sides of the glass carrying the bubbles -- particularly little bubbles -- with it, downward. After a while it stops, but it's really quite dramatic and it's easy to demonstrate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon also occurred in other beers, said Alexander&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The bubbles are small enough to be pushed down by the liquid. We've shown you can do this with any liquid, really -- water with a fizzing tablet in it, for example.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It's just paying attention to the world around you and trying to figure out why things happen the way they do...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2004/bubbles317.html&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1251" LastActivityDate="2014-08-25T14:49:06.853" CommentCount="0" />

These are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Microbar. There are two bars operating under this name, one in downtown Reykjavík, the other in Sauðárkrókur. The one in Reykjavík is the pioneer of the Icelandic craft bar scene. It is owned by the Gæðingur brewery, and appropriately, you can always find Gæðingur beers on tap here (among other local beers)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Skúli Craft Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is notable for its diverse and rapidly rotating taps. At any given time, about half of them are likely to  be connected to local beers. The bar is independent, but beers from Borg brewery are always prominent in their choices. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bjórgarðurinn, in Reykjavík. They have 22 taps, Icelandic craft beers always among them. They serve food other than bar snacks, mostly gourmet sausages that they recommend pairing with particular beers. It is a hotel bar, not associated with a brewery.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kaldi Bar, in downtown Reykjavík.

Large tap selection there, but no focus on local produce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Borg and Einstök taps can commonly be found interspersed with the common Egils and Víking taps. Steðji and Ölvisholt beers are only sporadically found on taps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many other bars (but &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not all) have some ambition when it comes to craft beer availability without making a particular deal of it. Hlemmur Square, a hostel/bar near the main bus station, is usually particularly well stocked. But always, ask your bartender!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Selected products&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, here are a few items I consider distinctive - or at least, I have not found anything &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; like them abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Garún. Imperial stout, more heavy on the licorice than most.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lava. A smoked imperial stout.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Snorri. An ale spiced with Icelandic thyme.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And always, keep an eye out for seasonal beers. The breweries usually allow themselves more creative freedom on those products. In 2014, we saw beers like the Einstök Arctic Berry Ale (beer flavored with Icelandic berries), Fenrir (an IPA smoked with sheep dung) and Hvalur (the whale beer mentioned earlier).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;General beer buying advisory&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;won't&lt;/strong&gt; buy Icelandic beers in the supermarket.

I am somewhat aware of the evolution of the UK brewing industry, but nowhere near as knowledgeable as I am about America's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, definitions.  Craft Beer commonly derives the Brewer's Association definition of a Craft Brewer.  Which is Small, Independent, Traditional.  Sparing the specifics it's a definition meant to exclude the world's largest brewing companies, and their &quot;crafty&quot; portfolios.  &quot;Crafty&quot; is a pejorative used to describe brands or brewers which may or may not produce good tasting beer, but are owned by the larger brands in attempts to diversify their portfolios.  While the BA is primarily focused on the American market, it seems most European writers defer to their terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Real Ale, is a distinctly British term.  Coined by CAMRA in the 70's it's more to do with the packaging and serving of the beer in the pub than the business scale of the brewer.  All Real Ale has to do is be cask conditioned and served via a gravity tap or hand-pulled with a beer engine.  This excludes a majority of what we in the US would consider craft beer, because it excludes anything kegged, filtered, force carbonated, or pushed with pressurized gas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leads to an interesting overlap where an unfiltered beer, carbonated by natural fermentation, could NOT be a real ale because it was kegged and served on gas.  Also, nothing prevents a large brand like Murphy's or Beamish (both owned by Heineken) from marketing a &quot;Real Ale&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These definitions aside: It sounds like you may just be an IPA fan.  Your craft beer list is entirely IPAs.  It's not really accurate to conflate Craft and IPAs because plenty of craft beers are stouts, rye beers, Scotch ales, English bitters, or totally non-traditional things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue you might have with &quot;Real Ale&quot; is a technical note.  Because it's exposed to oxygen as soon as the cask is tapped real ale tends to spoil if it's not drank quickly.  The characteristic tastes of oxidized beer are cardboard, and the characteristic tastes of beer left on dead yeast for way too long is soapy.  I can easily see that coming off as &quot;waxy&quot;, especially if it's warmer than you're used to drinking and you've just downed some IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beer today is probably the best its ever tasted because of refinements in production techniques and farming.  Consumers are becoming interested in what their beer is made of so the quality of ingredients and care on a whole is improving.  But real ale is a niche,  there are going to be great traditional brewers making phenomenal beer, but it's prone to spoilage if not treated well.  There may also be those using it as a marketing gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally a last point about industrialization:  It has vastly improved the quality of ingredient and process that all brewers use.  The huge brands we now have, all started off as craft at one point.  But if they are no longer craft they either couldn't weather the market and faced the choice of no longer being a company or selling to a business and risk becoming more about business than beer.  In the US we have large breweries proving you can still be pretty big and make good beer.  Sam Adams, Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head, Yuengling, are HUGE by craft standards and haven't compromised the quality of their ingredients because brewers are still in charge.  Industrialization will never prevent a brewery lead by a passionate brewer from making interesting beer, but leaving brewing decisions up to a business man will always making boring beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastActivityDate="2014-10-17T14:30:48.050" CommentCount="1" />

Using this, I arrived at a different formula that's probably more accurate (at 20°C, that is):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ABV = (99823 · ABW) ÷ (20923 · ABW + 78945)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Please see AlkonMikko's comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1445" LastEditorUserId="1445" LastEditDate="2015-08-20T14:47:39.657" LastActivityDate="2015-08-20T14:47:39.657" Title="by-volume/by-weight conversion formula" Tags="&lt;alcohol-level&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="0" />

The bitterness is ranked at 21. They also make a pils with a bitterness of 32.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel it should be added that beer brewed in Germany often conforms to the Reinheitsgebot or the German purity law of 1516.

Maybe an amber ale if you could find one that wasn't very hoppy.  The stable kilning process that enabled people to make pale malt wasn't really invented until the mid-1600's and wasn't very popular until the 1700s, so brewers in the 1600s would've used a sort of generic-y brown malt that might taste slightly burnt and premium beers may have been able to include some lighter malt that was much harder to make and find.

For the common man (not nobility), in particular, grain made up a substantial part of the diet, with meat being fairly rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Common beer was not aged for months or years like some beers today; rather, a batch might be produced in as little as half a week.  These are &quot;small beers&quot; (or &quot;small ales&quot;, for the unhopped variety), which are mildly alcoholic but drinkable in volume without unfortunate effects.  These small beers/ales were produced in the home/manor; it was just one more task for the cooks.  See, for example, Markham's &lt;em&gt;The English Housewife&lt;/em&gt;, 1615. (I don't know of an online copy, sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that this means that the pilgrims wouldn't have brought beer from Europe; it'd be consumed, or probably go bad, before they reached the new world. So they probably didn't have beer in their &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; year because they'd need to wait for a grain harvest.  After that, if they brought hops with them then they could have made small beers like from the old country; if they didn't bring hops, they probably made ales instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turkey would have been new to their palates (it's a new-world bird), but beer was commonly drunk with meals where they came from, and those meals sometimes included other fowl.  So, probably it pairs fine.

There's been big debates over to what degree they were aware that water caused diseases while beer did not, but a big factor was that beer was seen as nourishing (which it is) while water was not. In an age where getting enough to eat was a recurring challenge, this contributed to making people prefer beer/wine. In practice it seems people preferred alcoholic drinks for both reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, people would drink small beer as an everyday drink against thirst (and that's what children got, too), and beer proper for celebrations. That's actually a Finnish saying: &quot;small beer for work, beer for celebration&quot; (&quot;Kaljalla työt tehdään, oluella pidot pidetään&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Small beer was generally made together with beer. That is, they'd do a mash, and the first wort that's run off has the most sugar. As you keep pouring water through, obviously more and more sugar is washed out of the malts, and the wort keeps getting waterier. Eventually they'd stop, and make beer from the wort. Then they'd continue, and run off a much weaker wort from the remaining sugar in the malts. This was the small beer. Many places they would even do a third beer, which was so weak it would barely ferment. There were also other grain-based drinks, made from flour or bread, and typically sour and just barely alcoholic. Kvass is the best-known example, but there were many others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weak beer as an every-day drink continued for much longer than you might think. It was the introduction of tea/coffee that first started displacing it. Then, later, higher availability of milk, then juices and soft drinks continued the process.

Normally when you refrigerate kegs indoors they're hooked up to gas, so as pressure in the headspace drops it's less likely the keg will unseal itself.  Also, if the keg did freeze a bit the CO2 being forced into the headspace could conceivably go over the pressure limits of the keg, depending on how carbonated it was to begin with among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of leaving a bottle or can in the freezer to chill it quickly then forgetting about it.

Fruity flavor is just an accent more than the point of the beer.&#xA;Great examples: Hacker Pschorr, Hoegaarden, St. Bernardus&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dubbel - Dark, Belgian ales brewed with complex blends of malts resulting in deep, rich flavors and notes of dark fruits and spices despite lacking any of these ingredients.&#xA;Great Examples: Cordendonk Abbey Brown Ale, Chimay Red, Rochefort 8&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;German Wheat - Lots of styles within this, but these tend to be a bit heavier than witbier with more of a spicy character and less citrus. These range from the extremely light weissbier to dunkleweizens to the heaviest weizenbocks.&#xA;Great Examples: Weihenstephaner Weiss/Dunkel/Vitus, Schneider Weiss&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bock - Traditionally the heaviest of lagers, dark and complex but more mild than stouts. Little hop character with complex malts.&#xA;Great Examples - Weihenstephaner Korbinian, Ayinger Celebrator Dopplebock&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Others I might try are a good Coffee Stout Narragansett, a caramel porter like the Sam Adams Holiday Porter, and if you're really striking out with all these Abita's Purple Haze is probably the best fruit-added beer out there aside from sours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2607" LastActivityDate="2015-01-05T16:08:43.753" CommentCount="0" />

The tube is shaken vigorously using a wrist action shaker (though I know one guy who does this determination professionally who shakes by hand) for 15 minutes. If there is a slush in the tube, centrifuge until the iso-octane phase is separate.

The reason [major producers] don't sweat over the IBU inside that range is because the human palate can't detect the difference. Studies have shown that the detection threshold for bitterness is about 5 IBU. And that is for beers in the 10 to 15 IBU range.

An interest in the history and production of these beers is best served by Phil Markowski's &lt;em&gt;Farmhouse Ales&lt;/em&gt; and Stan Hieronymus' &lt;em&gt;Brew Like a Monk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To touch on a few of your questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previously alluded, beer served a utilitarian purpose as a dietary staple and nutritional supplement for an agrarian society. Beer was frequently brewed in large batches at regular intervals in support of farm life, and the result were table beers and saisons for work during the harvest and &lt;em&gt;bières de garde&lt;/em&gt; (loosely translated: &quot;beers for keeping&quot;) to survive the winters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbey ales are not as varied as they initially appear. Much of the variation in beers brewed in Trappist style come from fermenting different &quot;runnings&quot; of the same batches of wort (unfermented beer); to summarize &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; briefly, the strength is dependent upon the sugar content which is dependent on how many times the mashed malt has been &quot;rinsed&quot;.

So, it is certainly possible to remain consistent from bottle to draught, though it is less common and more costly to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both bottled and draught beers use nitrogen to add bubbles instead of CO2 on occasion. This is more common with malty beers, say stouts and porters, than it is for hoppy beers.

This creates the thicker mouthfeel that Guinness (as well as other nitrogenated stouts) are known for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CO2 will likely continue to be used for most hop-forward beers, since it pushes more aroma out of the beer (including the delicious hop scent!) while nitro is more about the mouthfeel and well-rounded flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few reasons why other beers don't use the small nitrogen ball devices (&quot;nitrogen widgets&quot;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Alcohol laws (or FDA or something?) doesn’t allow craft brewers to add&#xA;  widgets/foreign objects to alcohol (cans).

This fits the bill for Rickard's Red.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Aroma: Low to moderate malt aroma, generally caramel-like but&#xA;  occasionally toasty or toffee-like in nature.

Quite clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Appearance: Amber to deep reddish copper color (most examples have a&#xA;  deep reddish hue). Clear. Low off-white to tan colored head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Flavor: Moderate caramel malt flavor and sweetness, occasionally with&#xA;  a buttered toast or toffee-like quality. Finishes with a light taste&#xA;  of roasted grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish.&#xA;  Generally no flavor hops, although some examples may have a light&#xA;  English hop flavor.

Clean and smooth (lager versions can&#xA;  be very smooth). No esters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although examples containing&#xA;  low levels of diacetyl may have a slightly slick mouthfeel. Moderate&#xA;  carbonation. Smooth. Moderately attenuated (more so than Scottish&#xA;  ales).

In this way, they're very similar to amber ale/lagers, and the difference can be very subtle and is very subjective. If you like one, you'll 99% of the time enjoy the other. Most of what you mentioned- like Dos Equis and Yuengling- are marketed as ambers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, I looked up Honest Lager, and Walkerville markets it as Märzen (sometimes but not always the same as Oktoberfest) It's less hoppy and more full-bodied than a Pils or other pale lager, and tends to be reddish or amber in color. If you look a the German/import section of your local beer store or supermarket, you should be able to find an example of something similar, just look for the words &quot;Märzen,&quot; &quot;Oktoberfest,&quot; &quot;Festbier,&quot; etc. A Munich-style Dunkel would also probably be right up your alley. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Key words I would use: sweetish, medium-bodied, balanced, caramelly, toasty.

For whatever reason beer marketers greatly prefer the term &quot;amber&quot; over &quot;red&quot; when referring to lagers, while using &quot;red&quot; over &quot;amber&quot; when referring to ales eg Red IPA). These are lagers with a slightly sweeter profile than the &quot;standard International pilsner&quot; style churned out by every macrobrewery, due to the addition of Vienna, crystal, and/or caramel malts. Indeed, when looking at the  examples you gave on Rate Beer and Beer Advocate, RB considers both to be of the &quot;Amber Lager/Vienna&quot; style, while BA considers Dos Equis to be a Vienna Lager and Yuengling to be an &quot;American Amber/Red Lager&quot;. What's the difference? Generally, the &quot;American&quot; prefix at the start of any beer style means that it's hoppier, due to our lovefest with hops (at least compared to the Old World). Also, RB doesn't break amber lagers into American and not varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/amber-lager-vienna/36/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;category page on Ratebeer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/30/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Beer Advocate&lt;/a&gt; to browse through more examples of the style. Ratebeer's list is default sorted by rating, which isn't always helpful if you don't live somewhere with a great selection, but you can click on &quot;Count&quot; and it will sort by number of ratings; Beer Advocate's is default sorted by number of reviews. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two beers you mention are very widely available: On RB, Yuengling is #2 most reviewed and Dos Equis is #7; for rating though neither cracks the top 50. On BA, Dos Equis is the #3 Vienna Lager by reviews and #38 by rating, while Yuengling is the #1 American Amber/Red Lager by reviews and #21 by rating. For some great examples of Vienna/Amber Lagers you might be able to find, Sam Adams Boston Lager is rated #44 on RB and #3 on Beer Advocate (why the big discrepancy? RB users tend to be more heavily biased by the idea that certain breweries aren't &quot;cool&quot;, while BA users tend to be more objective).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is always the BJCP guide, which makes the rules that guide most homebrewing and professional contests such as the GABF. The GABF can have real reputation and financial influence for a brewery, so it requires very precise definitions, but outside of competitions most of the brewing world takes the BJCP with a grain of salt (or is it a grain of barley?). Personally, I prefer the Ratebeer and Beer Advocate's style categorizations.

I'd believe that.  Beer from a brewery's tap is likely incredibly fresh, which most people would agree for most styles is better.  Especially with how popular hoppy beers are in the San Diego scene, hops fade quickly...fresher will be way more aromatic.  The beer you buy in the store may have been filtered or pasteurized, has been bottled and then sat in a warehouse for a while before being trucked around the county and then sitting on a shelf for a while before you hauled it back home.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, is there an objective way to express &quot;Fresher is better&quot;?  Dunno, probably not.  You could run lab analysis and try to point at alpha and beta acid numbers, volatile organic oils or something...but it almost seems like trying to cobble together a theory after having made the conclusions already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The BJCP was mentioned in another answer.  What BJCP is, is an attempt to apply objective qualitative judgment to taste, which is inherently subjective, by asking folks to compare what they're sensing to an ideal example.  Basically &quot;How closely does this beer I'm tasting now adhere to description of the style of beer it's supposed to be?&quot;  They'll generally look at &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Head: color, density, how long it lasts. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aroma: malty? hoppy? spicy? grassy? sulphury? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visual: color, clarity &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Feel: thickness on the tongue, fizziness, acidity...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Taste: malty, hoppy, spicy... balanced?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you &lt;em&gt;COULD&lt;/em&gt; theoretically do is drink the beer at the brewery, and then describe as if it was a BJCP description, then drink the beer from the store and grade it according to how close it resembles the brewery beer in those categories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside of that, everything is subjective.

Long story short, as Europe was going through a technology renaissance period, ingredients used for brewing changed and grains that were converted into malt became lighter. Therefore, dramatically changing the &quot;beer&quot;, that was much darker at that time, now into and ale. As this changed the palettes of many at that time they also introduced a great amount of fresh hops to these new ales to make a strongly hopped ale. The term IPA was introduced as a well known brewer(s) started shipping this new type of beer to India, giving it the distinct name IPA-India Pale Ale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am providing this back ground to make a point. As this product was fermented, it was very typical to age and IPA Beer for a minimum of 1 year. This was done to assure that the beer was completely fermented and safe to transport on ships to India. This trip would take even more time and put the produced under various environmental stresses. This beer or &quot;ale&quot;, was hopped very strongly and even topping the very hoppiest beer on the market in the U.S. today. Using the freshest malt as well as the freshest hops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My final point or argument is, that as I recreate the IPA and use fresh ingredients typical to a real IPA, I find that my IPA's last over a year in the bottle. As I drink them 3 to 6 and even 9 and 12 months the hoppy flavors still remain and even develop. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many variables that allow me to get to this end result. This including yeast and malt selection, and also multiple methods that help produce beneficial fermentation, allowing the taste of the final product to be clear of flaws that would be created by the yeast during primary as well as the bottling (carbonation) period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After 30 years of beer making many of these truths become evident as I continually taste the final product, take very good notes and adjust my recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can say that with the correct procedure of beer making, an IPA can be enjoyed at various stages from 1 week and even up to one year and can still be enjoyed for its distinct hop flavor and aroma.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3926" LastActivityDate="2015-03-26T07:27:42.003" CommentCount="6" />

Well researched and void of conjectural inaccuracy. If hops were the only flavor in IPA then yes it could be decreasingly &quot;hoppy&quot; but that's assuming we're referring to the aroma hops. Your bittering hops would surely deepen with time. But with any beer there are more layers than one. High ABV beers will just broaden the chord change more as every flavor will carry different in the changing alcohol/water/sugar levels that time provides. Fruit in the beer no matter its place on the sweet/sour spectrum (notably normally high point as well) have similar success on the &quot;cool dark&quot; shelf. This is due to natural fermentation of organic matter  stored over time. Ever noticed how fresh salsa gets effervescent in your fridge?

Beer historian Ron Pattinson helps them design all those recipes based on his research, so they should be fairly accurate.

This is a linear scale so that becomes possibly twice as much pressure as a normal bottle...so yeah, thicker glass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At such high pressure you might find corks will stay put more reliably than a cap since it has more surface area in contact with the bottle.

While it is true that older beer bottled from barrel storage was carbonated during bottling it wasn't mentioned that historically beer was poured from the cask and therefore not carbonated beyond natural carbonation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this string cask beer wasn't mentioned but it is literally from the barrel. It is the smoothest and creamiest way to &quot;tap&quot; beer. It's also considered the best by many purists. It however has a huge limitation in modern applications. The barrels don't last as long and thereby need to be smaller, swapped out more often, and potentially wasted if not used quick enough. For this reason most businesses opt for the larger, easier, cheaper carbonated kegs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As stated before by Jeffrey Lin the Nitro is a newer solution but I have to take exception to his explanation of the unnatural side of Nitro. Really the purists are fine with nitro. They may not be particularly fond of the &quot;in-can&quot; nitro widget, but really the process just replaces a larger CO2 bubble with the smaller finer bubbles of dissolved nitrogen and thereby some dissolved C02 as well. Purists truly would be more likely to enjoy a cask pour but as Nitro, in a lot of ways, is closer to cask both in consistency and the &quot;creaminess&quot; described it goes without saying this would be enjoyed by the purists as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Beer for Nitro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of beer where smooth finer bubbles are appropriate. Guinness being only one that comes to mind but really most British milds. Also English ales, pales and creams just to mention a few. The older styles from England were flat compared to American lagers and most modern beers. Another good example is a Boddingtons. Finer bubbles fit the mold with anything that traditionally would be served from the cask. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with most new technology it serves a purpose and in this case the purpose is two-fold. Store without oxygen to prevent going bad, and keep with the original intended style of those types of beers. The discussion of flavor change is slightly off because flavor change would only be present if oxygen were allowed to be present in the beer when kegged. Texture change is more accurate and the nitro is an effort to more closely approximate that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope that is helpful to fill in some details and thanks to Sloloem for helping, hopefully it is more easily digestable/readable?

Some of these are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Warm beer foams too much. If your server is dumping tons of head down the drain to fill your glass with enough beer, it might be too warm.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Too much pressure in the keg makes beer foam too much.  The brewer carbonated it to the level they wanted, the bar might be over-carbonating it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cold beer does not foam very much.  If the kegs are chilled too cold or the bar is serving beer in a frozen glass, your beer is probably too cold.  Cold temperatures will dull flavors and kill aromas. Obviously if you're into beer for flavor, this is bad.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dirty glasses tend to dissipate the foam very quickly, so you could be drinking whatever was in the glass before, or soap scum... neither of which sounds very tasty.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Under-carbonated beer doesn't foam very much.  Under-carbonation can also dull flavors since so much of taste is based on smell and you can't smell volatile aromatics if there's no fizz to carry them out of the liquid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are various schools of thought on the head as an indicator of beer's quality or freshness but realistically this will vary by style.

While they're both styles of dark beer nowadays Mild is very low ABV with a lot of malty/nutty flavors and fruity sweetness.  Stouts are stronger than milds with no fruitiness and a lot of roasted and burnt flavors instead of malts.  Most will probably be more bitter and have less residual sweetness than milds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The long answer is:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Historically stout and mild were completely unrelated terms that referred to completely different things than they wound up being known for.  Both started being used in the 18th century.  Stout originally just meant strong and Mild was used as the opposite of Keeping (or Stale), which basically just meant the beer was fresh rather than being aged in a barrel for any length of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mild turned into a strength descriptor in the early 19th century when brewers started using the X, XX, XXX system to classify their ales, which referred to both the ABV and pounds of hops per barrel.  But Mild was still a pale beer.  As the 20th century progressed Milds started becoming more amber colored and playing more as malty and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All beers until this point were actually much stronger than we're used to today.  Barclay Perkins X Ale in 1839 was actually close to 8% ABV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grain shortages and government restrictions towards the end of WWI dropped Mild to close to 2%, and brewers also added dark sugars and mixed in amber and brown malt to keep some measure of flavor.  After the war ended ABVs bounced back up but new taxes in the 30s pushed them back down, close to the modern range for Mild.  Dark mild being the standard and Pale mild being a variant didn't really happen until the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The history of stout is quite a bit muddier, though the general consensus seems to be that it evolved out of Stout Brown Porter and has been largely interchangeable with Porter for most of its history.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The differentiation probably started with in the invention of Black Patent Malt in 1817.  In the late 1700s new technology had been invented that allowed brewers to track their efficiency and they realized the roasty brown malt they used for porters was really expensive compared to how much fermentable sugar it produced. So they started making porters out of mostly pale malt with brown malt and burnt sugars among other ingredients for color and flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Britain had banned the use of anything besides malted barley in brewing in 1816 which really kindof screwed porter brewers over.  With Black Patent they had something which was absurdly dark enough that they could finally make up the color difference using pale malt.  Though most brewers in England continued to use some portion of brown malt, brewers in Ireland switched completely to pale and black malts only.  Irish beer was also less hoppy than English beer in general since hops didn't grow as well in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Guinness renamed its XX Porter to Extra Stout Porter in ~1820 and the popularity and marketing gradually dropped &quot;Porter&quot; from the name, which is probably where Stout began to evolve as a style separate from Porter.  But it's in a bit of grey area, people in 2015 are still debating Porter vs Stout.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short version of the long story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mild originally just meant Fresh and as a style evolved from the weakest pale beer a brewery made, and only really became what we think of it as today in the last 60 years.  Stout originally just meant Strong and was a synonym for Porter for a very long time until marketing tried to differentiate it maybe 150 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the wall, but I fell down a rabbit hole of interesting beer history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastActivityDate="2015-07-13T20:39:08.277" CommentCount="0" />

Colorado is one of the oldest breweries in the country and, although it doesn't have a wide portfolio, its beers are easy to find at supermarkets, affordable and still very good. They have a very good english-american-hybrid IPA with 'rapadura' (a candy made of molasses).

I became aware of them last year completely by accident, in a trip to UK, and loved their &lt;em&gt;Modus Operandi&lt;/em&gt; beer. I also had another very light pale sour wich wasn't remarkable compared to the first one, but fairly ok. (I guess it probably should have had more time in the bottle to develop and reach its full potential).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sours beers are not for everyone, and the common first reaction to them is negative. But, if one get over that first shocking experience, go on and try it again, people usually fall in love with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are called &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; because they use in their fermentation process, in addition to possible other yeasts, &lt;em&gt;brettanomyces&lt;/em&gt; yeast, also known as wild yeast, a different species, found in some kinds of wine and belgians beers (lambics, flanders red), which gives very rustic but complex and delightful aromas to the beer.

That put aside, it can be anything. Belgians themselves don't give a damn about style definitions actually. They only follow their traditions (from the region where they live, their monastery, their community, whatever).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you are going to find beers varying from very shinning blonde to dark/ruby and thick ones that almost resembles a wine, which is the case of &lt;em&gt;Westvleteren 12&lt;/em&gt;, that one being the myth it is because it is not sold (at least officially) outside the monastery, and one is supposed to schedule and go pick it up personally with an amount limit, and everything.

Open fermentation is the practice of fermenting in an open vessel but in a controlled environment, not allowing other microorganisms to get in, like Anchor and Sierra Nevada still do these days, and sometime ago very common in the industry.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will probably never get a definitive answer to it but based only in my theoretical knowledge I would say &lt;em&gt;terroir&lt;/em&gt; is not so determinant as people use to think, even for spontaneously fermented beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first guess is that, aside from very extreme/sterile climates and landscapes, microflora in the air is pretty much the same, at least in terms of variety and the species that play a main role in spontaneously fermented beer, which aren't much more than a few (acetobacteria, sacharomyces, lactic bacteria and brettanomyces). I know, you can find hundreds of different bugs in a single lambic, but from all that, only a few really play an important role. You can see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329477/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this study here from UC Davis&lt;/a&gt;, based on Allagash's Coolship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing that supports this argument is that american breweries are successfully making lambic-style beers following almost the exact same traditional process as the belgian. But, then, one thing they've already learned is that one of the main factors in the early process of inoculation and fermentation is temperature, what implies year's season as well. Usually they leave the wort to be inoculated over night at fall. You can listen to what people from Allagash say about their &lt;em&gt;Coolship Ale&lt;/em&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the process, well, now it depends on infinite factors (barrels, wood, storage, temperature, etc). But, your question was about distance between places, what suggests the &lt;em&gt;terroir&lt;/em&gt; aspect of the production.

You get (if so) a consistent and regular flavor from those kind of beers &lt;strong&gt;only because people blend it&lt;/strong&gt; before releasing, once different barrels even of the same batch turn out to be completely different one from the other. So, again, that's why I think there isn't much sense to talk about &lt;em&gt;terroir&lt;/em&gt;.

It's very common with Imperial Stouts, for example, which is one of the styles that goes best with this kind of practice. Generally, boozy and dark beers are more suitable for this, but not only (people age belgian tripels, for example, which, while being sometimes boozy, aren't roasty at all).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, talking about oak, you get that vanilla, coconut, sherry flavors, sometimes some smoke from the barrel's inside toast, and things like that. Boozines is softened as well (mellowed). Off course, inside the barrel, a lot of complex reactions occurs, and I don't know how it can be compared with wine chemically, but, along with other compounds, tannins are incorporated to the beer, altough it doesn't always appear so much in the final product like in wines. It all depends on a series of factors, including the amount of time the liquid spends in the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides it, some aeration and in consequence oxidation does occur, but that's not the main purpose in that &quot;type&quot; of aging. Flavors of the original barrel's content may be picked as well, in higher or lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another main use of barrels in the beer industry is for production of wild/sour beers, in that case, the micro-aeration being a main desired factor. When people want to sour their beers and/or develop wild characteristics in it, they use different organisms after the primary fermentation. In order to sour it they use bacteria and for the rustic (wild) flavors they use another kind of yeast called brettanomyces in a further step of fermentation/maturation, in which oxygen presence is fundamental, but a slow pace is mandatory as well to avoid an overgrowth of the organisms and a possible &quot;spoilage&quot; of the beer. So, the barrel is a perfect place for this process to take place, because wood allows the oxygen to get in very slowly. Besides it, the barrel itself becomes a colony house for all those bugs (as brewers call those wild microorganisms), so you may not even need to pitch any yeast/bacteria after some time anymore. Off course, the wood alone impairs some flavors to the beer as well. You end up with a very, very complex product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These days, people are doing all kinds of crazy experiments you can think of, and there's no mandatory rule when using barrels. It all depends on what result you want to achieve and real-world experience as well.

A sour beer is what we'd consider to be a spoiled beer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a quick primer, &quot;wort&quot; is turned into &quot;beer&quot; when microbes convert the sugars in the liquid into alcohol, CO2, and ...other stuff.  Generally speaking, we use brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae for ale or Sacc. Pastorianus for lager) because the other stuff tastes pretty nice, or at least doesn't taste bad.  Various strains of the same organism produce different byproducts, an example would be an English ale yeast which is well known for compounds that are kindof sweet or fruity vs Belgian ale yeasts which are well known for being peppery, clovy, or banana-y.  Those flavors all come from the yeast used for fermentation, but it's only ever a single strain of yeast, which was isolated in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sour beers are basically defined by not using a single isolated, clean-tasting strain of Saccharomyces.  The most common sour yeast used is in a genus called Brettanomyces, which depending on the specific species can produce flavors like...horse saddle, bandaid, cheese, cloves, and vinegar.  But most sour beers are not strictly brewed with yeasts like Sacc. or Brett. but also have bacteria in them.  Most commonly lactobacillus and pediococcus which are known for producing large amounts of lactic acid, which is where the sour really comes from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say sour beer brewers are being sloppy, because their &quot;infections&quot; aren't accidents.

After the Industrial Revolution, with more hygiene and sterile tools, that characteristic became more and more uncommon, and at some point, undesirable. So, meanwhile, yeast was &quot;discovered&quot;, isolated, and fermentation controlled so that we had a clean taste profile, free from acids at all, which is what you know as beer nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't be fooled: &lt;strong&gt;what really sours a beer are bacteria, not &lt;em&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

They even call it beer before distilling and the brewing process is pretty much the same (again, except for the hops), although it doesn't go through secondary maturation. Off course, they keep the recipe very simple, on most cases probably using a single type of base malt and nothing else.

The brothers agreed to a partnership for 15 years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbachs until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are 4 different types of Rodenbach beers:&#xA; 1. Rodenbach Original (5,2% ABV) blended from aged and young ale (25%/75%);&#xA; 2. Rodenbach Grand Cru, a rich winey beer (6% ABV) which, although blended, contains less young ale (67%/33%) (in the past this beer was unblended aged beer from a single cask selected for its qualities by a tasting panel. This type of beer has now been renamed Rodenbach Vintage beer and is available in limited quantities);&#xA; 3. Vin de Céréale, an aged beer that is 10% ABV.&#xA; 4. In commemoration of the brewery 150th year of activity, it produced Rodenbach Alexander (5,2% ABV). It was a variant of the Original one with a cherry taste. It is name comes from the brewery founder Alexander Rodenbach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the take-over, Palm quickly stopped the production of Rodenbach's Alexander beer, a cherry-flavoured beer.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realbeer.com/news/articles/news-000720.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; title=&quot;Palm Explains Plans for Rodenbach Beers&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; When Palm Brewery bought Rodenbach, another brewery it owned already made a cherry beer. At that time Alexander Rodenbach had to be ceased for contractual non-compete sorts of reasons. However, in recent years, Palm/Rodenbach has produced and distributed, first, Rodenbach foederbier, which is served only from cask, and is unfiltered and unblended. It comes straight from an oak riping barrel and is not processed further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the bartender told you to drink your Rodenbach with a shot of cherry, so that you can taste the original Rodenbach Alexander (the cherry-flavoured beer, Rodenbach's erstwhile cherry beer which produced before the brewery was sold to Palm). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3722" LastEditorUserId="3722" LastEditDate="2015-07-24T04:22:14.763" LastActivityDate="2015-07-24T04:22:14.763" CommentCount="0" />

When you pour from the storage vessel to the glass you disturb the beer a lot which drives CO2 gas out, and that takes a lot of aromatics with it so the aroma you get from the beer in a glass is WAY stronger and more complex than what you'd sniff from the bottle or can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also smell is a pretty huge part of tasting something and when you drink from a glass you're putting your nose right into the thick of all that, so the flavor will be more intense as well.  Bottles and cans sort of keep that toned down since you don't smell the beer as much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There used to be a prejudice against cans because the liquid and the aluminum would react and oxidize, but they started coating the insides with a food safe epoxy resin decades ago and it's completely sealed now.  As far as taste goes there's no difference between the two, but cans actually store a bit better because they let in no light and no air while bottles will eventually let through enough to affect the beer.  Brewers like cans as well since they're more portable, don't shatter, chill faster, and are often cheaper to fill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastActivityDate="2015-07-24T14:08:30.490" CommentCount="1" />

The older it is, the worse it will taste, but having drunk more than one in a sitting, I can safely say it's no more harmful than drinking a fresh one. Never gotten sick off one, but it's pretty hard to down them without gagging a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some beers actually seem to intentionally go for a similar taste. Anything with a green bottle seems to be trying for a skunky flavor, while brown bottles help filter out damaging light. Compare a Beck's or Heineken to, say, a Budweiser.  The former will have a distinctly skunky flavor to them, basically similar to marijuana. The latter has a bit of a rice taste, as that's what's used in the brewing process, with a slight sweetness, but overall just a bubbly light flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Linus pointed out, there's going to be a &quot;wet cardboard&quot; taste with past-due light lagers. I'm guessing this is due to the breakdown of oils and sugars in the beer, as well as other general chemical changes. I'm not sure why it has that taste of cardboard or paper, but it's definitely present. After doing some research (aka looking it up on google), I found that the main culprit of that cardboard taste is a chemical called &quot;nonenal&quot;. It's apparently also a chemical in human body odor of aged people, leading to the so-called &quot;old people smell&quot;. This isn't proven, but there's some evidence that this is the main culprit for the somewhat-neutral scent of older people's perspiration.

However, if we want to play analysis, the answer would certainly be whiskey, American bourbon most likely. Let's go through the choices. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Wine. No way. If someone is going to generically order wine, they at least specify a color, red or white. Plus wine is mostly all the same strength, only varying a couple percent either direction, unless you count fortified wines, which are another topic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Beer. Ordering a generic beer would get you a basic beer, which isn't very strong. Only a few specialized beer bars would have any beers that I'd call really strong. Any beer stronger than 12% is going to be very rare, with most bars not even having above 8%. The kinds of people who order strong beers, these 8, 9, 10, etc beers, would always order by name. They are craft beer fans. These aren't really strong enough to help someone in distress. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Vodka. Unless you are a Russian or a huge vodka fan, you don't order vodka straight like this. Vodka is generally for mixing in America. The people who are serious about vodka drinking would order by brand name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) Gin is the same story as vodka really. Gin in generally served in mixed form, although a dry gin martini is close to 100% gin, it still counts as mixed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) Cordials, liquers, etc. Again, would be ordered by type or brand, and often not that strong compared to the main liquors. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6) Rum, can be quite strong, makes decent shots, makes decent sipping. But it conjours up images of pirate and or topical locations. If the movie is set in the Caribbean, they would mean rum. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;7) Tequila. It's strong, makes good shots. Not so great for sipping, unless you are talking about the really good stuff or you are a tequila fan. If you are in Mexico or a Cantina, they would mean tequila. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;8) Whiskey. This is the winning category. It's always strong. It tastes good in shots, and makes fine sipping from a glass. This is manly and good for all classes of life. Blue collars and white collars alike love whiskey. if you are doing, &quot;forget your troubles&quot; kinda drinking, whiskey is the best choice. If you are sad, or upset, or worried, or looking for a fight, or anything like that, whiskey is the best choice. A real American manly man is going to want whiskey, usually bourbon, something like Knob's Creek. Some will prefer Irish whiskeys, or Scottish Whiskys, (notice no e), but if they do, they will say so by name. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I know if I was upset like that and going to a bar and said a stupid order like gimme a strong one, I would mean bourbon. If I wanted a beer, to get back on topic, I'd be like, &quot;What kind of IPAs you got?&quot; &quot;Any sours?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;:)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4397" LastActivityDate="2015-08-07T02:27:20.380" CommentCount="0" />

This is not&#xA;  a fad segment like packaged draft, dry, ice, clear, or perhaps even&#xA;  red. While growth in the craft segment will slow, it will not peak&#xA;  quickly and then lose share, as the fad beers have. The&#xA;  craft/specialty segment has firm underpinnings from homebrewers and&#xA;  other beer aficionados. Many of the homebrewers prefer to brew their&#xA;  own beer (done right, it’s even better than the best of the craft&#xA;  brews), but they often sample commercial brews to try unfamiliar or&#xA;  difficult-to-brew styles, and of course they’re top prospects for&#xA;  drinking craft brews when they are at a restaurant or brewpub.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That explains a lot through the 90's, but why the quicker increase in growth patterns in the last 10 years?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brewersassociation.org/news/ba-insider-growth-craft-beer-segment-sky-limit/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brewers Association&lt;/a&gt; (a US-based trade group): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Between 2011 and 2013, 80% of craft growth came from new craft&#xA;  appreciators, the majority of which were in the 21 to 29 age group,&#xA;  and their impact is still muted. Lester Jones of the National Beer&#xA;  Wholesalers Association (NBWA) sees Millennials as not fully&#xA;  economically activated yet due to the impact of the economic recession&#xA;  and their struggle to transition into aging Baby Boomer jobs. This&#xA;  means as the economy improves we should feel the impact of the&#xA;  Millennials even more. The message here is the fastest growing and&#xA;  most influential demographic is also moving the fastest toward craft.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pair this with the increased ideals behind &quot;Trade-ups and premiumization&quot;, and you have people willing to spend a little more to gain an perceived increase in value and quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/craft-beer-production.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IBISWorld&lt;/a&gt; shares that craft beer has enjoyed a 19% growth in the past 5 years.

This is what you had with your  Köstritzer. It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Black IPA / Cascadian Dark Ale&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The American fascination with hops has shown that the addition of toasted malts can give a hoppy, bitter, and coffee-like experience to these beers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Black Saisons&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the Black IPA, I've seen a few breweries start brewing their saisons with roasted malts.

The occasional offering that we sell (Niagara College Teaching Brewery), uses oysters at the end of the mash regime (hot soaking of the grains).

It also happens to be the perfect temperature for cooking oysters. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oysters cooked or uncooked could be added at other parts of the process, but may not have the same impact on reducing astringency.

Thus, while the beer is reasonably popular, the interest is hyper-localized to a single city.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are there other examples of beers that have high sales volume but are hyper-localized, or are Baltimore and Natty Boh unique in this respect?

That said, for getting beer out of the cask/keg/barrel you generally have 3 options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressurized gas.  As mentioned by the other answer this is most commonly CO2 since CO2 is produced by yeast, so if you sealed the container while yeast were still processing sugars and producing CO2, they would pressurize the container.  Some brewers, especially home brewers, will pressurize their kegs through natural carbonation but most just push CO2 from a canister.  BUT there's also &quot;beer gas&quot; which is a mix of Nitrogen and CO2, think Guinness or Boddingtons.  This came into use to emulate the soft carbonation of cask/real ale/kellerbier, which leads to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siphoning.  A hand pump, or beer engine, uses a siphon to &quot;pull&quot; the beer out of the cask and up to the tap.  The physics needs atmospheric pressure to be maintained inside the cask, so it's usually open to the air at the top.  This required a fast turnaround on casks to prevent the beer from spoiling, which is one of the reasons cask/&quot;real&quot; ale fell out favor.  Kegs simply kept longer and were more economical.  I think CAMRA still isn't a fan of them, but some bars use &quot;breathers&quot; which basically add very low pressures of CO2 to replace the volume lost by the beer, but not enough to pressurize the cask.  This just lets the beer last longer in the cask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gravity pouring.  This tends to happen most often at festivals or if a bar has a &quot;guest cask&quot;.  A spout is installed in the side and beer pours out.  All the caveats about air spoilage from cask ale still exist here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if the bartender pulls a handle and leaves it there until the glass is full of beer, that's a pressurized gas system.  If the bartender has to keep pulling the handle to fill the glass and the beer has that cool &quot;cascading&quot; look, it was pulled by siphoning.  If the cask is on the bar and the bartender just opens a spigot...that's a gravity pour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know that there are any other options...maybe an open barrel and ladling the beer out like soup?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastActivityDate="2015-09-18T13:59:46.247" CommentCount="2" />

Ultimately sweet beers are part of the style they are in so avoiding sugary sweet beers is as simple as knowing the styles.  You can skip to the bottom if that's all you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of sweetness that are often discussed and sometimes confused in beer, a Malty flavor and a Sweet flavor. The same ingredients are involved but in different ways.  Sugary sweet beers basically come from unfermented sugars which simply means sugars that the yeast hasn't processed to create alcohol and carbon dioxide.  This is also called attenuation.  Wikipedia has a good link for this but I can only post two links at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This can be caused by a few different things such as unfermentable sugars that come from the way the beer is mashed (when the grains are mixed in with hot water and left to sit for a specific length of time) or from specialty grains, or the yeast itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The explanation of how the mash affects sweetness is very complex and full of biochemistry.  I will try to summarize.  Grains are full of starches that need to be converted to sugar for the yeast to ferment.  There are two main enzymes involved in this process, alpha and beta amylase enzymes.  Using a branched tree analogy works great.  After a strong storm you need to clean up your yard from the limbs that have fallen from the trees.  You have a lopper (alpha amylase) which is great for cutting the branches apart from the limbs but still leave you with long branches and twigs.  You also have a chipper (beta amylase) which is good at taking the branches and twigs and cutting them into little pieces that are easy to use.  The two enzymes need to do their work together to make the most fermentable sugars out of the starches stored in the grains.  Alpha amylase is good at breaking the limbs apart into long starch chains but these are not easy for yeast to ferment.  Beta amylase is great at making small glucose chains that the yeast can convert but the big limbs are too big to get into the chipper, if the alpha amylase doesn't do its job first the beta amylase cant do its job well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kicker is each enzyme works in a specific temperature range (beta amylase 131-150°F and alpha amylase 154-162°F).  A brewer can manipulate the mash temperature to ensure both enzymes are working with an overlapping temperature (for instance 152°F) or adjust the temperature up or down to accentuate one enzyme over the other.  For instance if we mashed at 158°F the beta amylase will denature and not affect the beer, while the alpha amylase will be very happy and busy.  This will result in more long starch molecules in the beer which are harder for yeast to ferment and result in a sweeter beer!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfermentable sugars can also come from specialty grains added to the beer for flavor and intentional sweetness.  The usual suspects are roasted grains where the sugars inside the grain will start to caramelize such as Dark caramel and roasted malts like Crystal 80, Crystal 120, Special B, Chocolate Malt, and Roast Barley.  Below is a great place for people to start learning the intricacies of brewing beer at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtobrew.com/section4/chapter20-1.html&quot;&gt;http://www.howtobrew.com/section4/chapter20-1.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately these things are done by brewers to make their beer fit into the style they are trying to make along with other things like the amount and type of hops used and other adjuncts (stuff added to beer like fruit or rice or...)  So to avoid sugary beers you mainly need to know what styles are not sweet or its as simple as saying know what types of beers you like.  If you really want to learn the styles turn to the Beer Style Guide!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php&quot;&gt;http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look around and see which are sweet and avoid, meanwhile look for highly attenuated beers.

The large volume of ingredients means that the beer will (usually) have complex malt flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mashing:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;We immediately run into a problem: You can only get so much sugar out of malt. So you use all sorts of tricks to get the most out of your malt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boiling:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;To increase the sugar content the brewers add sugars to the wort. Next problem: too much sugar and the beer does not taste very good and fermentation problems are a possible problem. (Sugars can also be added to the fermentation). Another trick is to concentrate the wort by boiling for a longer period. The water evaporates, but the sugars and other ingredients stay in the wort. Note that a large amount of hops is required to balance all the sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fermentation:&lt;/strong&gt; High gravity beers are notoriously difficult to ferment. The biggest problem is that the alcohol in the beer becomes so much that it poisons the yeast. So, you need a yeast that is &quot;strong&quot; enough to work in these harsh conditions. You will often find that brewers will mix strains, starting with a lager, then going to ale, then to champagne or wine yeast. Most &quot;normal&quot; yeasts will (with help) get you a product of 15-20% ABV. Stronger yeasts can go higher than 20%, but not much further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Fermentation:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Lest assume that you ended with a naturally fermented product of 20%. Fermentation is complete and your yeast is dead. The alcohol kills any other yeast that you add. What next? Ice concentration! This process is seen as a form of distilling. You put your fermenter in a freezer and scoop out the ice crystals. As water freezes before alcohol, the alcohol in the beer increases. Stronger beer! But the penalty is that you use a lot of flavour and aroma during this process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The final product:&lt;/strong&gt; A boozy, typically malty, bready, product, usually on the sweeter side.

It was not until I tasted ale imported from England that I liked it and sought it out.  I loved Samuel Smith's, Old Peculiar, Bass Ale, and others.  I expanded from there and sought out other beers and ales that were not your ordinary North American Lagers and found many I liked.  I quickly discovered homebrewing while perusing a used bookstore.  This was way before it was popular here and way before 'Craft Brewing' was a term that people knew.  I started to make my own.  Now I really like beer. However I still don't really like most of the big-brand beers.  And I don't drink beer as a thirst quencher.  But if someone offers me a beer - I am no snob and say yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as DNA or genetically based dislikes.  I don't think there is a 'beer' gene.  There may, however be genes that make people dislike, or at least avoid certain tastes or aromas, or perceive these in different ways. These could then translate to dislikes of beer.  However, there are so many types of beers that this is probably very unlikely.  It would at least it's unlikely that beer would be the only thing that would be affected by this inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think a dislike of beer can be overcome.  Many people have notions of beer that are not really true.  A friend said she hated dark beer because it was too bitter.  I explained that this was not really true (that all dark beer is very bitter). So, I brought over some examples that were not bitter, but chocolaty, sweet, roasty, etc.  She now loves dark beers (most are actually not very bitter).  With some people it is really difficult to overcome these dislikes however.

Until this time beer was flavored with a mix of herbs and spices called &quot;gruit&quot; which was taxed (generally by either the government or the Roman Catholic Church) and in many cases required by law, so when hops did appear, they appears in regions where the church had less control.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hops didn't make their way to England until around 1500 A.D., and weren't universally used until around the year 1600.   Since Henry VIII reigned from 1509 until 1547, it would have been early in the introduction of hops to the region, and it is certainly within the realm of possibility that he may have outlawed them as a threat to the tax revenue stream provided by the sale of gruit.   Eventually though, demand for hops won out, and Henry's own wars with the Catholic Church may have weakened the ability to gruit rights-holders to continue to monopolize the market, and as I mentioned, by fifty years after Henry's death, hops ultimately won the war.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2015-12-30T21:14:12.107" CommentCount="2" />

Think of a cognac glass versus a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bierwoordenboek.com/getfile.aspx?file=Glazen%2FAmsterdammer.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vase&lt;/a&gt;. Some glasses also take in you nose deeper than others.&#xA; - the way the beer flows. The shape of the glass how quickly you can drink it without spilling. Think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.potjebier.nl/bier_glazen.asp?f=show&amp;amp;id=14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;kwak&lt;/a&gt;, you HAVE to drink the last very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question: there are many factors how the glass influences how you taste a beer. What's best is very subjective. You could at first stick to the opinion of the brewer, what he finds the best glass for it. If you like the taste with an other glass better, use that. I would not approach this as a hard science. Brewers might choose a specific glass to &quot;stand out&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4921" LastEditorUserId="4921" LastEditDate="2016-01-08T17:16:06.170" LastActivityDate="2016-01-08T17:16:06.170" CommentCount="1" />

Sometimes beer in the bottle is pasteurized, while the keg is not. Sometimes one or the other is filtered, while the other is not. The gas content can also differ, since this is adjustable in draught systems but not with bottles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, such as when yeast content is very important for the flavor profile of a beer, like German Hefeweizen, how much yeast you get in your glass has a big impact on the drinking experience. When drinking from the bottle, you can make sure that you get all of the yeast from the bottom of the bottle into your glass by agitating the last few ounces of beer, but this isn't possible with a keg. &#xA;Kegged versions of these beers still have yeast in them, but you're not getting that perfect ratio in every glass. In my two years as a beer enthusiast living in Germany, these beers are almost always served from the bottle, and every bar or bartender has their preferred method for getting all the yeast out of a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question two&lt;/strong&gt;: What is done to bottled beer to prolong its shelf life?&#xA;This also differs from beer to beer. Some imports are pasteurized in the bottle, some others, namely MillerCoors products, use proprietary hop derivatives like Tetrahop to keep hop flavor while minimizing hop oils' susceptibility to producing off-flavors due to light exposure. This isn't a bad or unnatural thing, and I hope this becomes more widespread, because skunked, lightstruck beer is awful. (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2010/12/03/131785456/Searching-For-Science-In-A-Glass-of-Beer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt;) This, however, is also present in kegged beer, as it has other beneficial properties like increased head retention.&#xA;Sometimes, though, nothing is done beyond packaging, like Sierra Nevada's transition from twist-off to pry-off caps a few years ago to combat leaking, infection, and oxidation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/sierra-nevadas-new-pry-off-cap/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brookston Beer Blog 2007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question three&lt;/strong&gt;: Why is draught so much better?&#xA;Very, very subjective, and you may want to clarify or qualify this in the future. Is good draught beer better than old, skunked bottled beer? Yes. Is good bottled beer better than flat draught beer poured through dirty lines? Also yes. Each has its pros and cons when it comes to service and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would venture to say that much of draught beer's appeal comes from it being special- you typically have to go somewhere else to get it in a way that's not usually available to the home user, like how the theater experience differs from the home movie experience. Yes, you can get bottled beer in bars, too, but it's still a more &quot;normal&quot; format. In terms of taste over experience, though, I don't know that you could say for sure without some sort of blind tasting with lots of variables (age, glass type, line cleanliness, CO2 pressure) controlled for. Even then, what does it for the tasters might not do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For further reading on all that goes into draught beer, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.draughtquality.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DQM_Full_Final.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Draught Beer Quality Manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3879" LastActivityDate="2016-01-06T16:27:55.250" CommentCount="0" />

Under canon law this is permitted because La Trappe is the motherhouse of the Trappist Order. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The history of the Trappist Foundation in 1997 is of a totally different perspective.

It depends heavily on the barrel itself (remember, it's wood, a biological element), the storage conditions of each of them (temperature, for example, which varies depending on the position of it in the warehouse) and some other random factors. So, the only way to achieve a consistent and reproducible product is blending, trying to fuse all those different characteristics in the right proportion, giving you an expected final product. In this process, is even common having to dump some barrels, which will not make it on the final proportion (maybe, let's say, you have too many very sour barrels, and you don't want your beer to be so that sour).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, another common practice is to blend aged beer with the young (not aged) version of it. Beers like Rodenbach, for example, are like this (Rodenbach Grand Cru has 2/3 of aged beer with 1/3 of fresh beer). Dogfish's Burton Barton is a blend of wood-aged and fresh IPA, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, blending beer is not exactly a new thing. I understand that your question was about blending different styles of beers, which is still less common, probably because the brewers will try to do that from the beginning, with the ingredients, but is not an heresy.

It also depends on country's legislation or even the state, when it comes to USA. As far as I know, expiring dates for beers are even not obligatory by law in many american states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides that, some breweries inform the bottling date, others the expiration date, which is less useful, because if you are a experienced drinker you know how old (or not) you want your beer to be, despite what the producer has estimated for it. So, in those cases, first you need to figure out the given shelf-life of it, and count backwards, to know when it was bottled. Pretty messy. I age beers and I'm quite used to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in general, when that information is not clear, your best (and maybe only) friend is the web - the brewery's website or forums.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, Anchor Brewery has a very particular (and weird) code standard for bottling date, but it is well explained on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anchorbrewing.com/brewery/faqs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The date code currently being used by Anchor Brewing Company (post-October 1991) replaces the clock-face that used to show the bottling month as one of 12 small notches around the main label. A three character code is now included on the new back label of the bottle. The code works like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first character is always numeric and represents the last digit of the year. The second character is always alpha and represents the month by using the first letter of the month unless that letter has already been used:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;January: J, February: F, March: M, April: A, May: Y, June: U, July: L,  August: G, September: S, October: O, November: N, December: D&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The third character in the code is either alpha or numeric and tells the day of the month. The first 26 days are represented by the alphabet with the remaining days listed as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;27th through 29th = 7 through 9, 30th = 3, 31st = 1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;An example of a date code would be: January 20, 2012 = 2JT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not all breweries are so transparent like that, though.

The keg to tap resistance must be matched by the gas tank push pressure. The gas pressure puts in a little CO2, the liquid line squeezes a little out. However, in long draw setups where the draft line has a lot of resistance the push pressure would have be so high that a lot more CO2 would be dissolved into the beer.  The amount of CO2 squeezed out would cause very foamy beer. How to solve this?  Mix in some Nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, the &lt;strong&gt;Nitrogen will never blend into the beer.&lt;/strong&gt;  It is used as an inert gas to maintain the pressure in long draw lines.  Any change in carbonation would come from the mix ratio.  If the mix is too low in CO2, as the keg empties the beer will go flat since not enough CO2 is being forced in.  If the mix is too high in CO2 then the beer would gain carbonation from the beer gas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your ratio of 30% CO2 / 70% N is more suited to a Nitro tap setup.  Traditional nitro beers have an original carbonation level of around 1-1.5 volumes of CO2.  The amount of CO2 needed to maintain this carbonation level is minimal &lt;em&gt;PLUS&lt;/em&gt; the faucets that pour these beers have an extra plate that restricts the flow even more, forcing almost all gas out of the beer.  Without that specialized faucet, the beer coming out would just be flat with maybe a few sad bubbles of CO2 but no thick head of foam that you'd expect.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4637" LastActivityDate="2016-02-17T22:06:33.417" CommentCount="0" />

Hops were known and added to beer relatively early in the Middle Ages, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, in my opinion, the key differences are variety and technology. Not only do we have a greater variety in styles, but we have more varieties of hops, malts, and different yeasts. These create wildly different flavor profiles unheard of centuries ago. Technology has allowed us to create more consistency in beers, as well as increasing variety indirectly through different techniques used in brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a pretty nice article on the history of beer: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if you want to try some beers brewed in traditional styles, they are out there.

The common grain at the time was 6-row malt, today the most &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/zymurgy/zymurgy-extra-2-row-vs-6-row-barley/&quot;&gt;common brewing barley is 2-row&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Understanding of the malting process has drastically improved. Today we understand how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brewery.org/brewery/library/Malt.html&quot;&gt;get perfectly malted barley&lt;/a&gt;. Historically the malt would have been over or under modified.  Under modified would have lots of unconverted starch which would leave a hazy beer that tasted rather bready. Over modified malt would would have no starch, but less sugar than possible so the resulting beer may lack body.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kiln dryers allow for greater variety of malt. By controlling the heat cycle, the same variety of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbd.org/brewery/library/Malt_AK0996.html&quot;&gt;barley can make different malt&lt;/a&gt;.  Drying the grain in medieval times consisted of heating it over a fire.  Fire dried grains would have a smokey flavor that would be present in the beer.  The traditional Scottish Ale uses malt that has been dried over a fire where the fuel is peat, which is a very distinct smoke flavor.  The fire also was not nearly as exact or even as a modern kiln so some kernels would be burnt and other may be under cooked, so to speak. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Water&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Needless to say, but water purity is drastcally better today than in the 6th-15th centuries.  Because the brewing process boils the water, the beer was safer to drink than the water. Hence the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_of_Soissons&quot;&gt;patron saint of brewers&lt;/a&gt; said &quot;Drink beer, not water.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dissolved mineral content of water and pH control.  Medieval brewers had the water that they had.  Today, a brewer can start with distilled water and add whatever minerals they desire to change the flavor profile and pH of the mash.  The water pH can effect the mash efficiency and fermentation profile of the beer.  This lack of water control lead to specific styles coming from specific areas. I.E. Burton upon Trent is known for pale ales, Pilsen for golden pilsners, Munich for malty lagers.&lt;a href=&quot;http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/understanding-the-mash-ph/balancing-the-malts-and-minerals&quot;&gt;Some water source mineral content.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Hops&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers were not hoppy. Hops were not used extensively in beer until about the 12th century and were not cultivated en mass until about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britishhops.org.uk/history-of-hops/&quot;&gt;13th century&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://beer.stackexchange.com/a/4643/4637&quot;&gt;Most beers older than that were bittered with Gruit.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The hops that were used were not high in bittering acids.  The oldest common hop varieties are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beersmith.com/blog/2012/02/05/noble-hops-for-european-beer-styles/&quot;&gt;Noble hops&lt;/a&gt;.  Just like today, costs of ingredients was a major factor in brewing.  Making a really hoppy beer was prohibitively expensive.  Just compare an English IPA brewed from old recipes vs. an American IPA.   &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Yeast and Microbiology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is where modern technology really helps out.  Louis Pasteur discovered yeast in 1857. Up until that time, the changing of sugar into alcohol was considered magic or an act of god.  It was understood that the foam on top of a fermenting wort could be passed around to other vats of wort to start the process (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/exploring-the-german-technique-of-krausening/&quot;&gt;Krausening&lt;/a&gt;). Others would transfer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000103.html&quot;&gt;Magic Sticks&lt;/a&gt; from batch to batch to start fermentation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are other microorganisms that can inhabit beer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces_bruxellensis&quot;&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus&quot;&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediococcus&quot;&gt;Pediococcus&lt;/a&gt; to name a few.  These can cause a sour, acidic flavor in beer.  Some ancient breweries would just let the cold night air in through an open window in order to cool the freshly boiled wort, exposing the warm sugar solution to whatever might land on it.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thermometers - The temperature of the mash can affect the fermentabilty of the wort. The temperature of the malting and drying affect the sugar content of malted barley.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chemical cleaners - All of the brewing equipment is sanitary. Modern living through chemistry.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Food storage/availability - I can get whatever ingredients I want, whenever I need them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Refrigeration - I can cool the wort in controlled conditions. Beer can travel farther. I can ferment at optimal yeast temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More than can possibly be named...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The Result?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would be sweeter and thicker than today's thanks to less fermentable sugars in the wort due to inconsistencies in the brewing process, and inconsistencies in the malting process and poor yeast/microorganism control.  The alcohol content would be lower as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would not be hoppy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers would have to be drunk quickly before they spoiled.  The other bugs in the beer would turn the beer bad after a few weeks.  This also prevented the beer from traveling very from from the brewery.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers could vary greatly, batch to batch.  The brewers of the times were very skilled with what they could work with, but they were constrained by what ingredients they could use, whether by law or availability.  Flavor can be affected by fermentation temperature, so a hot day in December could ruin my beer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ancient beers were dependent on the season. When was the grain harvested? When is it cool enough to ferment?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably more information than you need, but hopefully it helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4637" LastActivityDate="2016-02-19T17:09:15.807" CommentCount="1" />

Budweiser sits at 5% ABV. IPAs are often in the 5-7% ABV range, so let's call an &quot;average&quot; IPA 6%. You will feel the alcohol substantially more quickly in the 6% IPA than in the 5% Budweiser.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lifehacker has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/why-a-5-beer-gets-you-drunk-so-much-faster-than-a-4-b-1725622428&quot;&gt;nice article&lt;/a&gt; that explains this phenomenon well, but it boils down to the rate at which your body can process alcohol. Suppose that 1% ABV corresponded to 1 &quot;alcohol unit.&quot; If, for example, your body could process 4.5 alcohol units/hour, after 6 pints of a 5% ABV beer (1/hr), you'd have 3 alcohol units left in your body [(5.0-4.5)*6]. However, you'd reach the same mark after only 2 beers (1/hr) of a 6% ABV beer [(6-4.5)*2].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Version: It probably has to do with the beer's ABV you were drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Side note: There is a lot of variability in strength within any given style. If you like IPAs, you should check out Session IPAs - They are IPAs designed to be lower in ABV than the average IPA, so you can drink more of them in a drinking &quot;session.&quot; For a list of the top Session IPAs and more information on the style, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/session-ipa/121/&quot;&gt;Ratebeer's Session IPA page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5107" LastActivityDate="2016-02-25T20:16:07.823" CommentCount="0" />

However, unless one is brewing a beer style that warrants it (like a &quot;Saison&quot;) the general rule is to keep the beer fermenting below 20°C.  Ideally, 18-19°C is best.

Bourbon, which is typically aged as few as 4 years is aged in casks of new wood, meaning there are more compounds in the wood to be extracted, and they can be extracted more quickly.  Scotch, on the other hand, which is often aged from 10-25 years, is aged in previously used barrels, so it takes longer to extract the desired level of flavoring compounds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much flavor you want the wood to add to the finished product.

When concentrated in reduction sauces, they can become harsh.

Subtle characteristics, by contrast, normally disappear with cooking. To maintain balance, check your recipe for acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar and cut back to make room for the acid in the wine. This is especially crucial when cooking with white wine. For delicate fish or vegetables, a dry non-oaked wine works best. If your recipe is packed with onions, carrots and tomatoes, there will be plenty of sugars in the pot, so cooking with a fuller-bodied, less dry red or white wine can integrate perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winemag.com/2007/02/19/cooking-with-wine/&quot;&gt;For deeper flavors,&lt;/a&gt; experiment with fortified wines like Port, Sherry, Madeira and Marsala.

It needs to be inexpensive, obviously, but that doesn’t mean it should be undrinkable so don’t just chuck in the tail ends of bottles you may have hanging round the kitchen. And you don’t want a wine that’s too heavily oaked though that’s relatively unlikely if it’s cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s a fair amount of inexpensive own-label Corbières I’ve noticed lately which would fit the bill perfectly or try a basic Portuguese red. Most recipes add water as well which brings down the cost and stops guests getting too plastered but adjust the amount to the strength of your wine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whole spices work better than ground ones otherwise you can get an unpleasant powdery sensation as you drink. Cinnamon is probably the most popular spice but you could also use cloves, cardamom (lightly crush a few pods) ginger and nutmeg. Some recommend star anise but use sparingly if you don't want your mulled wine to taste of aniseed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most recipes call for sugar but you might want to add a little less than they suggest if your wine is particularly soft and fruity or if you add port.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am very fond of cinnamon in my mulled wines at Christmas time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5064" LastActivityDate="2016-04-22T03:09:20.427" CommentCount="0" />

Refrigeration will decrease a bottle's temperature 4 to 5 degrees each half hour in the first 60-90 minutes. After that, temperatures will drop 2-3 degrees per half hour. Riesling should be chilled for 4 or 5 hours, a chardonnay for 1-2 hours, merlot for an hour and cabernets for a half hour or less. If time is short, a freezer will drop the temperature about 6-8 degrees every fifteen minutes.

Beef steak has lots of strong flavor from the meat itself and from smoke, marinade, sauce, or pepper, so it calls for choosing a wine that is also full-bodied. Cabernet Sauvignon’s robust fruit tastes and powerful flavors can stand up to most any steak. The tannins in Cabernet Sauvignon (coming mainly from the red skin of the grape)  and relatively high alcohol levels also help cut through the fat of the steak, making the wine taste smoother and less bitter… and the steak more flavorful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;California Zinfandel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Zinfandel has moderate tannins and high acidity, making it a fitting match with steaks that contain relatively good amounts of fat. Rib Eye, T-Bone or Porterhouse steaks are ideal partners for Zinfandel. A little less refined than  Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel has a characteristically bold grapey spiciness and thick richness on the pallet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malbec&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Malbec is an up and coming red wine that is definitely steak friendly. In fact, Malbec is the number one consumed red wine in Argentina where it’s considered the ideal wine to pair with beef.  Malbec is a versatile, rich and food-friendly red wine that may break with tradition but won’t break the bank. Check out Malbec wines from Argentina or Chile.

Exposing wine to air for a short time, or allowing it to oxidize, can help soften flavors and release aromas in a way similar to swirling the wine in your glass. Young red wines, especially those that are high in tannin, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, most Red Zinfandel, Bordeaux and many wines from the Rhône Valley, actually taste better with aeration because their tannins soften and the wine becomes less harsh. Another method of aerating a young, tannic red wine is to roughly decant it into another container, which exposes more of the wine's surface to air than simply removing the cork from the bottle. Uncorking a bottle and letting it sit undisturbed for period of time actually does very little to let the wine breathe as only a small percentage of the wine is in contact with air. A much better suggestion is aerating the wine in your glass or in a wine decanter. A decanter is defined as any vessel other than the original bottle that will hold the contents of the wine and allow for air to mix with the wine within. Usually, these are broad-bottomed glass or crystal containers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Wine and air may have a negative effect on each other. To simplify, let us consider the following: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;• Wine poured from a bottle into a glass and swirled is positive since the air mixture allows aromas to be displayed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;• Wine that has had a brief exposure to air is positive since it allows wine to breathe similar to stretching its legs after being cooped up in the bottle for so many years. This exposure has a positive effect on the wine after 25 to 30 minutes. Intensely tannic or younger reds may need up to a few hours. In general, most red and white wines will improve within the first half hour of opening the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;• Extended exposure to air has a negative effect on the wine.

By the early 1500s, several principalities in what is now Germany had passed laws requiring that all food and beverage containers be covered to protect consumers against these dirty insects. The common mug also had to be covered, and this was accomplished by adding a hinged lid with a thumblift.

Bourbon also needs to be stored in new charred-oak barrels, whereas whiskey barrels do need to be oak but not new or charred. &quot;Lastly, to be called bourbon, the liquid needs to be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125.&quot; For other whiskies the liquid must be distilled to no more than 190 proof.

The company is the largest whiskey producer in Tennessee and wields an outsize influence on liquor laws in the state; they lobbied the state legislature to create such stringent requirements for labeling Tennessee Whiskey. Other whiskey producers in the state, including UK-based Diageo that owns Tennessee's No. 2 whiskey distiller George Dickel, oppose these criteria and are lobbying to have them loosened. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some consider Tennessee Whiskey a Bourbon, while most do not. The fact remains that both Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel's are filtered through maple charcoal making them a different product. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is scotch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The main difference between &lt;a href=&quot;http://mentalfloss.com/article/30278/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-scotch-whiskey-and-bourbon&quot;&gt;scotch&lt;/a&gt; and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long should &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/faqs/&quot;&gt;Scotch Whisky&lt;/a&gt; be aged?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is not possible to lay down any precise age as being the best for a particular whisky. Generally speaking, Malt Whiskies require longer to mature fully than Grain Whiskies. UK and EU law insist that Scotch Whisky should be at least three years old. However, it is the practice of the trade to mature for substantially longer than the legal minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is rye?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thrillist.com/vice/rye-vs-bourbon-vs-scotch-whiskey-types-explained-guide-to-different-types-of-whisky-whiskey&quot;&gt;Rye whisky&lt;/a&gt;, like its name suggests, is a whiskey that is distilled from at least 51% rye.

Is it harmful to drink milk after taking alcohol at night?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A.  Alcohol prevents the breakdown of nutrients present in milk into usable molecules by decreasing secretion of digestive enzymes. Alcohol impairs the nutrients absorption by damaging the cells lining the stomach and intestines and disabling transport of some nutrients into the blood. In addition, nutritional deficiencies themselves may lead to further absorption problems. Even if nutrients in milk are digested and absorbed, alcohol can prevent them from being fully utilized by altering their transport, storage, and excretion. Alcohol increases acid in the stomach. That can result in gastritis or stomach or intestinal ulcers. If you have a family history of diabetes you may be more vulnerable to problems with alcohol. Milk, on the other hand if taken at night after it is warmed and flavoured with a small amount of ginger root, it is very nourishing to the body and also calms the mind, leading to a good night's sleep. It could well be that the reason warm milk helps us sleep is due to the fact that it is a food rich in the amino acid L-tryptophan. L-tryptophan helps the body produce neurotransmitters such as serotonin. Neurotransmitters are chemical nerve messengers that tell our bodies to shut down at night; as well as helping us to be fully awake during the day. The milk, which is designed to be drunk warm as part of the bedtime routine can also be enjoyed during the day without causing drowsiness. Alcohol, on the other hand, disrupts sleep.

In his arsenal of weapons, the recruiting Sergeant offered any perspective recruit a bounty of over two month’s worth of wages to enlist. Some were offered the option to enlist for limited time of service, usually a 7-year term, and receive a smaller bounty, but most chose the other option: service for life. Calculating one’s options in life must have been difficult for the recruit in a noisy, smoke-filled Ale House after consuming a number of gills of rum, happily provided by a member of the recruiting party. While the recruiting prospect drank endless rounds from the punch bowl, his ears were filled with stories of an easy life as a soldier, quick promotion and how women to could not help but be drawn to a man in a red coat. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The members of a recruiting party were all quite motivated in convincing say a young weaver or labourer to join as each was paid handsomely for each recruit they brought before the army surgeon for inspection and got attested by a Justice of the Peace. If the potential recruit hesitated to enlisted, deception was applied. A recruiting sergeant recounted:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;…your last recourse was to get him drunk, and then slip a shilling in his pocket, get him home to your billet, and next morning swear he enlisted, bring all your party to prove it, get him persuaded to pass the doctor. Should he pass, you must try every means in your power to get him to drink, blow him up with a fine story, get him inveigled to the magistrates, in some shape or other, and get him attested; but by no means let him out of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why the expression &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.royalscotsgrenadiers.com/kingsshilling.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;To Take The King's Shilling:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The expression 'to take the king's shilling', meant to sign up to join the army. Rather like with the 'prest' money for the 'impressed' man, a bonus payment of a shilling was offered to tempt lowly paid workers to leave their trade (an average daily wage during the Napoleonic period was 2p (at 12p to a shilling, this represented six days wages in one go). Once the shilling had been accepted, it was almost impossible to leave the army.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Since the army was not seen as an attractive career, recruiting sergeants often had to use less than honest methods to secure their 'prey', such as getting the recruitee drunk, slipping the shilling into his pocket and then hauling him before the magistrate the following morning (still hungover) to get him to accept the fact that he was now in the army. Sometimes the 'King's shilling' was hidden in the bottom of a pewter tankard (having drunk his pint, the unfortunate drinker found that he had unwittingly accepted the King's offer). As a result, some tankards were made with glass bottoms. Other recruits came from the courts, where a criminal's sentence could be commuted to service in the army - still the case (apparently) with the Blackwatch Regiment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In fact the bounty for joining the army was much larger than a shilling.

A third less common type would be spontaneous fermentation (a natural beer fermentation process taking place in the wild). Typically, only one fermentation process occurs during production (either bottom, top, or spontaneous fermentation). It basically describes what happens to the yeast during fermentation- some yeast float to the top of the liquid during fermentation, while some types of yeast sink to the bottom. Which type of fermentation takes place, depends on the type of yeast used in the process. So to answer your question, if it effects the type of drink (and taste), the answer is yes. It's not so much whether the yeast sink to the bottom or float to the top that affects the taste/style, but it is rather due to the type of yeast which determines what will happen to during fermentation (float to top/sink to bottom). For instance, lager strains of yeast typically float to the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Beeradvocate.com: &#xA;&quot;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more in-depth summary can be seen at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/101/yeast/&quot;&gt;Beer Advocate's Yeast Guide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5482" LastEditorUserId="5064" LastEditDate="2016-05-27T13:08:22.930" LastActivityDate="2016-05-27T13:08:22.930" CommentCount="0" />

But I'm really wondering here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up mash means dropping some corn and water into an ugly barrel, and add a sack full of sugar (like... 25 kilograms?), this gives you alcohol ready to distill in two, at most three days. Old barrel with wooden lid, no fermentation lock needed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In winemaking, while adding sugar is often frowned upon anyway, regardless of what you do, you generally try hard &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to get the sugar contents too high at the beginning since that &lt;em&gt;inhibits&lt;/em&gt; fermentation. Using any old barrel for fermentation is... well, something you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; probably do, but would one want to?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 liters distilled give 8 liters of 50-55% moonshine. Since alcohol does not appear out of nowhere, this means the mash must necessarily have 20% of alcohol. That's quite steep for a random mix of stuffs in an old barrel. My yeast usually tolerates 16-18% at most. Admitted, there are special high-alcohol yeasts as well as &quot;turbo&quot; yeasts, but they make no mention of any such thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get mash ready to distill in two days (20% in 2 days, that's, well... wow) but if you heat it up to around 70°C (so, basically killing the yeast!), you can do it in hours, not days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a &quot;booster&quot; which is basically a second cooling spiral in a box, doubles the amount of alcohol you get out. As does a cooling spiral in the main tank.&#xA;Since the booster cannot possibly create alcohol out of nowhere, does that mean that one normally operates at below 50% efficiency?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the distill from copper is useful because it absorbs the large amounts of sulfur dioxide that are generated during fermentation. More copper, more good.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In winemaking, if you get noticeable amounts of sulfur dioxide, it means you fucked up the fermentation (except when making fruit wine from oranges, there it's pretty common).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malted corn needs no yeast for fermentation, and you get no headaches from it that way. I'm inclined to believe the opposite as far as headaches go, since no yeast means you run a wild fermentation. In winemaking, this is normally something that you absolutely want to avoid if you can help it. Wild fermentation, and rapid, ultra-high alcohol production?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moonshine sells for 25-30 dollars per liter.

It has become embedded in the cultural and economic traditions of the city.  In fact, in 1450, there were 1,022 taverns in Rome.  Producers of Frascati owned almost all of the taverns.  It has been said that Frascati is the most often mentioned wine in Italian literature.  Pope Gregori XVI, in the first part of the 18th century, said it was his favorite wine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The wines made in close proximity to Rome are collectively known as Castelli Romani, nine communes that produce wine in the Alban Hills, which are just south of Rome.  The vineyards range from 200 to 1,000 feet in altitude.  The Soils are well drained and volcanic.  The Mediterranean provides some influence but the climate is more affected by the hills.  Of these, Frascati is the most famous.  It has historically had a widespread reputation as an inexpensive and serviceable white wine served in the cafés of Rome.  The potential, however, is there to really improve the wines.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tourelles.com/spip.php?article116&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mas des Tourelles&lt;/a&gt; offers some unique &lt;strong&gt;“Archeological Roman Wines”&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These wines are only available in France (and in few quantities in Germany).&#xA;   As many people contacted us to have informations on the way to buy and taste these wines in the US, you should know that it is hard to export wines without having a registered importer. It need also that this company can after deal with a reseller that can work with all the states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mulsum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Like testifying the passages of Pline the eldest, the blend of wine, honey and a certain number of plants ans spices (cinnamon, pepper, thyme ect...) are usedin making this famous wine, which was often served to the « gustatio » (before the meal as an aperitif).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, it also accompanies filet of duck with figs, small quails with grapes and pine kernels, very spicy dishes, Roquefort or chocolate fondant.

The addition of seawater, fenugrec, defrutum (grape juice concentrated to boiling point) ect..., during the vinification makes an amazing and complex wine. Roman dishes, such as oysters ans smoked fish, are wonderful with our wines of recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, in the years of 2746 - 2747, you will be able to serve it with fried foie gras or cakes with nuts. To serve at 18°. « The fenugrec confers it to the particular « vin Jaune » taste and it has a detectable smell due to the notes of nuts and almonds. The taste of the Turriculae proves to be rich and supple with a round prune flavoured finish.&#xA;   (La Revue des Vins de France - Mai 1999)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carenum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This sweet wine, described by Palladius, is produced by fermenting very mature grapes with plants, quince and defrutum. A delicately viscous and silky wine notes of quince and subtle aromas of crystallised peaches, it is a wonderful accompaniment with “foie gras” and fruit tarts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To serve at 14°. « The wine is of an amber colour, and its smell hesitates between peach and caramel. These smoky and caramel notes are also present in its mellowt taste. It makes a very nice aperitif ».&#xA;   (La revue des Vins de France - Mai 1999)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make things a little more interesting it could be noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/italy-wine-archaeology&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Italian Scientists have planted vineyards with the aim of making wine using techniques from classical Rome described by Virgil.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Archeologists in Italy have set about making red wine exactly as the ancient Romans did, to see what it tastes like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;At the group's vineyard, which should produce 70 litres at the first harvest, modern chemicals will be banned and vines will be planted using wooden Roman tools and will be fastened with canes and broom, as the Romans did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Instead of fermenting in barrels, the wine will be placed in large terracotta pots – traditionally big enough to hold a man – which are buried to the neck in the ground, lined inside with beeswax to make them impermeable and left open during fermentation before being sealed shut with clay or resin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5064" LastActivityDate="2016-06-09T01:19:14.660" CommentCount="0" />

However, it does offer gin recommendations for various types of gin. Their number one all around recommendation is in fact &lt;strong&gt;Greylock.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Plymouth&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Plymouth is technically both a style and a brand – how’s that for pizzazz? Plymouth is remarkably gentle. It has a sweet, delicate nose and a woodsy, lemony body. You might even get a bit of cinnamon bark on the palate. The finish is quite smooth, making Plymouth ideal for the bare bones martini. If the idea of drinking a cocktail that’s basically straight liquor freaks you out, Plymouth is a great gin to start with. It’s so welcoming, the first few sips of your martini might evolve into gulps. Drink cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Bombay Sapphire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is about as old timey as it gets. Savory, agreeable, and wonderfully cohesive, Bombay Sapphire is a gin that was born to hang out in a martini. While this low-key gin runs the risk of getting lost in fruitier cocktails, it rests perfectly alongside vermouth to create a balanced martini. Sapphire’s traditional botanicals (like coriander and grains of paradise) latch onto one another to make something great. Think of Sapphire as the perfect chocolate chip cookie: it seems simple, but one taste of a failed contender tells you it ain’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Citadelle BEST ON A BUDGET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you’re at a great bar and ask for a basic gin cocktail off-menu, there’s a good shot you’ll be tasting Citadelle. This French gin is a great quality purchase. Plenty of orange and overall citrus give Citadelle a nice burst of fruitiness without being fruit forward per se. While there are some floral notes to work with here, Citadelle really straddles the line between unique and eccentric, making it a great choice for a more aromatic, flavor-packed martini. Plus, at around $25, you don’t have a lot to lose. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Euphrosine #9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;All right, so Euphrosine #9 isn’t exactly traditional. In fact, it’s like you took the floral notes in Citadelle and pumped them up a notch (or three). Still, there’s enough palatable sweetness to make Euphrosine #9 a happy martini gin. If you’re looking for a martini that’s on the sweeter side, reach for this NOLA-born pick from producer Atelier Vie. You’ll pick up on hibiscus, berries, and sweet iced tea. Dare we say it, there’s something rather flirtatious about Euphrosine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The Botanist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hey, here’s something from Islay that isn’t Scotch! Bruichladdich crafts this interesting gin, which is made from thirty-one botanicals, twenty-two of which are native to Islay. While that may seem like an overwhelming amount of botanicals when compared to the standard seven or eight, The Botanist holds itself together surprisingly well. This is a complex gin, with a floral nose and an herbal palate. We get chamomile, mint, and citrus zest. Because this gin is so layered, you might want to add even less vermouth than usual. When it comes to your standard martini, The Botanist will really do all the talking, and in this case, that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Gin Mare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you prefer your martinis dirty? Then use Gin Mare. Seriously, this Spanish gin seems to be genetically engineered for a dirty martini. In a rare instance where branding fits product, Gin Mare is a Mediterranean gin made with olives, thyme, and rosemary amongst other herbs. The viscosity of the gin, combined with its garden-fresh taste, makes it the ideal spirit for a martini with just a hint of olive tartness. With this spicy yet still contained gin, you’ll feel like you’re going beyond a basic martini. Gin Mare is a great example of how a spirit can be both contemporary and classic at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Terroir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Made from the gorgeous distillery at St. George’s Spirits, Terroir gin uses local Douglas fir. Unsurprisingly, Terroir gin was created as an homage to California’s natural resources. While drinking “fir” might put you off at first, it seems that the plant works to intensify the juniper, giving us a gin that has classic pine notes. This gin has a generous layer of crisp juniper bite, yet there’s a certain earthiness to it that prevents it from being too harsh or simplistic. Expect grassy notes, moss, tree sap, and of course, a heavy coat of juniper to round this all up. Like Bombay Sapphire, this gin is as solid as a California redwood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Greylock BEST OVERALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This mighty gin from Berkshire Mountain Distillers has received tons of praise – and rightfully so. Straightforward, London Dry, and clean as a whistle, Greylock is a fantastic martini gin. Spicy licorice combined with lemon peel, black pepper, and a touch of cooking spice make Greylock both approachable and complex. Greylock will add lip-smacking flavor to your martini while still boasting enough unique spiciness to make your cocktail truly special. A hint of sugar-coated juniper berry will give way to just enough sweetness to make your martini quaffable as can be. This is an A+ gin for making martinis – we guarantee your guests will be happy with this crowd-pleaser.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Dorothy Parker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Named after satirical poet and general snark icon Dorothy Parker, this gin from New York Distilling Company would make Ms. Parker proud. Similar to Euphrosine #9, the floral nose is rich with hibiscus, elderflower, pear, and cranberries. The juniper peaks its head around on the blooming palate and the finish, which is zesty. While this is half a world away from Greylock, it’s perfect if you’re looking to whip up a martini that’s a little lighter, bubblier, and of course, a bit more tart – like Ms. Parker herself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recommendation are always a hard subject to put across to others because what one person may enjoy, another may find less than favorable!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/how-to/a1560/martini-gins/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Town and Country Magazine&lt;/a&gt; offers their &lt;strong&gt;5 of the Best Gins for a Classic Martini.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boodles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanqueray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. George&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aviation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Mountain Distillers Greylock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I am a fan of &lt;strong&gt;Beefeater&lt;/strong&gt; as is seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/04/best-gin-for-a-martini-cocktail-taste-test-fords-beefeater-bombay-plymouth.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;The Best Gin for a Martini!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford's Gin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beefeater&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bombay Dry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plymouth Gin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bombay Sapphire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5064" LastActivityDate="2016-06-11T13:23:25.267" CommentCount="0" />
