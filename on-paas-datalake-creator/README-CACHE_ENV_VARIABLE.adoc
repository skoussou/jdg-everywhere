<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_TYPE		Determines whether this cache should be distributed or replicated. Defaults to distributed.						Example: replicated
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_START	Determines if this cache should be started on server startup, or lazily when requested by a service or deployment. Defaults to LAZY.	Example: EAGER
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_BATCHING	Enables invocation batching for this cache. Defaults to false.										Example: true
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_STATISTICS	Determines whether or not the cache collects statistics. Disable for optimal performance. Defaults to true.				Example: false
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_MODE		Sets the clustered cache mode, ASYNC for asynchronous operations, or SYNC for synchronous operations.					Example: ASYNC
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_QUEUE_SIZE	In ASYNC mode this attribute can be used to trigger flushing of the queue when it reaches a specific threshold. 
				Defaults to 0, which disables flushing.													Example: 100
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_QUEUE_FLUSH_INTERVAL	In ASYNC mode this attribute controls how often the asynchronous thread runs to flush the replication queue. 
					This should be a positive integer that represents thread wakeup time in milliseconds. Defaults to 10.				Example: 20
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_REMOTE_TIMEOUT	In SYNC mode the timeout, in milliseconds, used to wait for an acknowledgement when making a remote call, 
					after which the call is aborted and an exception is thrown. Defaults to 17500.							Example: 25000
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_OWNERS		Number of cluster-wide replicas for each cache entry. Defaults to 2.								Example: 5
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_SEGMENTS		Number of hash space segments per cluster. The recommended value is 10 * cluster size. Defaults to 80.				Example: 30
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_L1_LIFESPAN		Maximum lifespan, in milliseconds, of an entry placed in the L1 cache. Defaults to 0, indicating that L1 is disabled.		Example: 100.
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_EVICTION_STRATEGY	Sets the cache eviction strategy. Available options are UNORDERED, FIFO, LRU, LIRS, and NONE (to disable eviction). 
					Defaults to NONE.														Example: FIFO
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_EVICTION_MAX_ENTRIES	Maximum number of entries in a cache instance. If selected value is not a power of two the actual value will default to the 
					least power of two larger than the selected value. A value of -1 indicates no limit. Defaults to 10000.				Example: -1
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_EXPIRATION_LIFESPAN	Maximum lifespan, in milliseconds, of a cache entry, after which the entry is expired cluster-wide. 
					Defaults to -1, indicating that the entries never expire.									Example: 10000
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_EXPIRATION_MAX_IDLE	Maximum idle time, in milliseconds, a cache entry will be maintained in the cache. 
					If the idle time is exceeded, then the entry will be expired cluster-wide. Defaults to -1, 
					indicating that the entries never expire.											Example: 10000
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL	Interval, in milliseconds, between subsequent runs to purge expired entries from memory and any cache stores. 
					If you wish to disable the periodic eviction process altogether, then set the interval to -1. Defaults to 5000.			Example: -1
<CACHE_NAME>_JDBC_STORE_TYPE		Type of JDBC store to configure. This value may either be string or binary.							Example: string
<CACHE_NAME>_JDBC_STORE_DATASOURCE	Defines the jndiname of the datasource.												Example: java:jboss/datasources/ExampleDS
<CACHE_NAME>_KEYED_TABLE_PREFIX		Defines the prefix prepended to the cache name used when composing the name of the cache entry table. Defaults to ispn_entry.	Example: JDG
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_INDEX		The indexing mode of the cache. Valid values are NONE, LOCAL, and ALL. Defaults to NONE.					Example: ALL
<CACHE_NAME>_INDEXING_PROPERTIES	Comma separated list of properties to pass on to the indexing system.								Example: default.directory_provider=ram
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_SECURITY_AUTHORIZATION_ENABLED	Enables authorization checks for this cache. Defaults to false.							Example: true
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_SECURITY_AUTHORIZATION_ROLES		Sets the valid roles required to access this cache.								Example: admin, reader, writer
<CACHE_NAME>_CACHE_PARTITION_HANDLING_ENABLED		If enabled, then the cache will enter degraded mode when it loses too many nodes. Defaults to true.		Example: false 



CACHE_CONTAINER_STATISTICS		Determines if the cache container collects statistics. Disable for optimal performance. Defaults to true.			Example: false 
CACHE_NAMES				List of caches to configure. 
					Defaults to default, memcached, and each defined cache will be configured as a distributed-cache with a mode of SYNC.		Example: addressbook, addressbook_indexed 
DATAGRID_SPLIT 				Allow multiple instances of JBoss Data Grid server to share the same persistent volume. If enabled (set to true) each 
					instance will use a separate area within the persistent volume as its data directory. Such persistent volume is required to 
					be mounted at /opt/datagrid/standalone/partitioned_data path. Not set by default.						Example: true 
					(I think it needs PV & PVC created previously (see 
					/home/stkousso/Stelios/Projects/Events/2018/jdg-TECH-MEETUP/jdg-ocp-setup/YML-BACKUP/01-ocp-jdg-datalake-datagrid-pvol.yaml  
					/home/stkousso/Stelios/Projects/Events/2018/jdg-TECH-MEETUP/jdg-ocp-setup/YML-BACKUP/02-ocp-jdg-datalake-datagrid-claim.yaml
DEFAULT_CACHE				Indicates the default cache for this cache container.										Example: addressbook 
																						(else 1st on CACHE_NAMES)
HOTROD_SERVICE_NAME			Name of the OpenShift service used to expose HotRod externally.									Example: DATAGRID_APP_HOTROD
INFINISPAN_CONNECTORS			Comma separated list of connectors to configure. Defaults to hotrod, memcached, rest. Note that if authorization or 
					authentication is enabled on the cache then memcached should be removed as this protocol is inherently insecure.		Example: hotrod
